# CURRENT STATUS:

-   First twilight hasn't occurred yet
-   Everyone is still alive
-   Maria is in the garden after Rosa went Rosa mode
-   The typhoon has arrived
-   Maria is searching for the rose

**[12-1-22]**

-   She (Maria) is approached by an unknown person (Erika?) in the rose garden
-   _Genji_: Someone arrived at the mansion, claiming to have drifted here after an accident at sea\*
    > Is this believable? Note that the drifter is claiming this\*
-   Krauss and Natsuhi are being surprisingly accommodating
-   **ERIKA HAS ARRIVED**
-   Probs doesn't matter, but her boat was named Eternal Maid II and she arrived thanks to several miracles (Bern)
-   Erika is Bern as a game piece?
-   Beatrice cannot object to Erika's existence because she is a vegetal :(
-   # I (Bern) proclaim that Furudo Erika is the detective
-   # The detective isn't a culprit. No proof is needed to show this
    > Knox's 7th
-   _Lambda_: There was an exception clause in the original
    > Huh? What does she mean here?
-   # Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now
-   # She does not exist in the worlds before this one, nor does she influence them
-   # Furudo Erika only increases it by one person. Besides her, the number of people on this island is exactly the - same as it was in previous games
    > So there are 18 people. Kinzo is dead after all.
-   # Ths number of people in this parlor now is equal to the total number of people on this island
    > Again, 18. But that wasn't said in red.
-   Erika will borrow the bedroom next to the cousin's room on the 2nd floor of the guesthouse
-   Genji contacted the police and her family
    > VERY important to note that the police could actually be contacted at this time
-   She fell from a boat UNOBSERVED by the others on board
-   Bernkastel and Ronove appear and note that Erika **is a witch**
    > Random thoughts: Ronove is an analogue for Genji, and Virgilia transformed into Kumasawa back in Episode 3
    > Would it be possible for Beatrice to be Shannon's magical counterpart?
    > This might line up with something discussed on the beach back in Episode 3, where it was mentioned
    > Shannon was Battler's first love 6 years ago or whatever, and Shannon distinctly remembered everything
    > Also worth nothing that this is the Beatrice of the game board
-   _Beatrice_: Let's see how good Bern's next piece after Ange is
    > She's aware of Ange's existence in the prior game.
-   _Eva_: **Don't tell me you secretly called your illegitimate child to today's family conference, Rudolf?**
    > Okay, this is probably foreboding. I'm bolding this.
-   If you solve the epitaph, you can become the next Head

    > Remember, we're wondering why the epitaph is there to begin with.

    > **SHE SAID THE LINE**

-   _Erika_: By using deductive reasoning based upon my theory, it seems likely that Kinzo doesn't want the successor, Krauss, to inherit that position too smoothly

    > Please kill yourself

-   The sengoku commander Hideyoshi admired, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, made his son in law Hidegetsu commit seppuku
-   Rumored to have done this to make Hideyori, his real son, his true heir
-   _Erika_: If Kinzo wanted Krauss to be the successor, he wouldn't put out the epitaph like that for everyone to see
-   Maria brings up the golden land when asked what she'd do with 20 billion yen
-   Erika is about to solve the epitaph
-   Battler, Bern, and Lambda are dragged into fucked up nothing void universe
-   _Lambda_: You mustn't lose your purpose, you'll fall into the depths of eternity and become a scrap of ocean seaweed
    > This is what happened when Beatrice denied Battler's existence at the end of Episode 4
-   Fragments are fragments of worlds
    > Oh we're back to episode 3 when Eva solved the epitaph
-   _Evatrice_: The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations. The only past Father held dear happened in his childhood years.

-   The hometown isn't Odawara
-   Lambda ensured that there would be no explicit mention of the hometown
    > What do we know so far? It isn't Odawara.
    > Kinzo really likes Areca nuts. Specifically in relation to Vietnam, where they're a symbol of lovers/marriage
-   _Lambda_: If it wasn't a hard riddle, **there'd be no point to it**.

    > How is this a hint?
    > [1] The purpose of the riddle is intrinsically linked to its difficulty? So like a test?

    > We need to figure out the hometown.
    > _Evatrice_: It didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it. If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget about it? Think of a river. A river. Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea.
    > What are some things that can flow through a hometown? Family tree is interesting. Maybe the moving of family?
    > Like, maybe the mansion is something to consider here. There's a flow of descendants that come and go.

-   Eva knew where the hometown was, so she ignored the sweetfish part. We don't know the hometown though.
    > Does this mean we need to focus on that part?
    > Okay... so not literal sweetfish, since we're not dealing with a literal river. What's so special about sweetfish?
-   Eva verified she was correct after going to the library and looking at... an atlas? And an encyclopedia?
    > Make sure we know what books she used. We can work backwards
-   As you travel down, you'll see a village
    > Eva had a flash of insight and realized what the village _could_ be
-   She questioned whether it would be "okay" if this was the answer.
    > Does this mean it involves a really fucked up or morally odd assumption?
-   The [village|shore|idk] does not have 6 characters. But there might be a way to read it with six characters.
    > Still pretty far off from finding the key itself though...
-   The key is six characters long.
    > The key chooses 6. The 6 in question are the characters of the key
-   By the first twilight, we have the 6 characters of the key, and some extra ones.
    > The two who are close... what could that mean?
    > Oh, we need to remove the key's characters from something that's AT LEAST 6 characters long. We don't need more keys...
    > That is one option. "The first twilight".
    > The second twilight says "tear apart the two who are close". What could this mean in an alphabetic context?
    > Maybe it means separating out two letters that aren't spaced out? But we still don't have a key...
    > f irst fi rst fir st t wilight twi light twil ight twili ght
-   Third twilight, praise my noble name
    > Insert "kinzo" somewhere?
    > Make it "look" like Kinzo somehow? Goldsmith?
-   Original list of characters is 11 or 13 characters long? In other words, subtract 6 to get 5 and be left with "Kinzo"?
-   > So this third twilight was like a way to check your work...
-   > Unless it's 13 characters long. In which case we need to crush the two characters instead of separating them
-   > One potential option is translating it to Thai: "S̄nṭhyā ræk" is 11 characters including the space
-   # ABOVE WAS REVEALED TO BE WRONG
-   **POSSIBLE LOCATIONS**
    -   China
    -   Korea
    -   Taiwan
    -   Hong Kong
    -   Vietnam
    -   Cambodia
    -   Laos

    -   Singapore
    -   Myanmar
    -   Guam
-   If we assume that Kinzo wrote the epitaph, then the reasoning on [1] is sound. But what if Beato wrote it?
    > Beatrice WANTS them to solve the epitaph. She gains something from it. But why make it so hard then?
    > Let's think for a second. What does Beato gain by making it so difficult?
    > [2] Oh... we can think of it as a test again. She wants to find a particular person? The person she's looking for would be able to solve the epitaph.
    > But who exactly is she looking for, and why? And how is this connected to the sin Battler committed six years ago?
    > Kinzo died, Beatrice carried out his will as the alchemist, following the epitaph.
    > Eva is the only one who solved it, and she was the sole survivor of game 3. Well, more accurately, she murdered the only other person who solved it, and became the sole survivor. Was the gold a true motive? No, she must have had other reasons for doing so.
    > Basic idea: Beatrice carried out Kinzo's succession test, and Eva, naturally, became the new Head. But what does SHE gain for that? This was just an act of loyalty more than anything else
    > What other reasons could there be? Check line [2]

[12-3-22]

-   _Rosa_: Instead of the first twilight, it's the tenth twilight that bugs me.
    > Probably referring to the "once and for the last time" part
    > What odd wording. It almost implies you can do it more than once, and that this has been done before.
-   _Rosa_: I've always thought that this 'first twilight' was nothing more than a place one-tenth of the way on a road to the Golden Land
    > This might not be a theory worth discarding yet.
-   The first twilight is the first stop on that ten-day journey
-   For this theory to bear any fruit, you need the start point and end point.
    > Maybe not. If we only know the start point, we can consider notable locations that are at most one day away.
-   _Rosa_: The place father spent his time when he was a boy really is far away. (NOT ODAWARA)
-   Battler leaves, sees Erika unlocking a door on his path **on the first floor**
-   _Erika_: I just wanted to search for something
    > OH IT'S THE LIBRARY FUCK SHE KNOWS
-   Erika pulls out an atlas to check her work.
-   The key is the first place you'd reach on a ten-day journey. We start from Kinzo's "hometown"

-   Someone probably suspects Kinzo's death
    > Ronove and Virgilia are in the study (Genji and Kumasawa)
    > Beatrice as well. (Shannon?)
-   _Virgilia_: We'll take Kinzo out of the study and have him tightrope walk from shadow to shadow where the toxin cannot reach
-   Natsuhi isn't a fan of repeating the same plan as last year
    > Note that Virgilia asks for permission from Natsuhi to execute the plan. Like she's a servant
-   _Natsuhi_: No one can determine the contents of a cat box that no number of people could ever hope to open
-   Man who mentioned taking revenge for the events of 19 years ago might be Bern's piece
    > The events are Beatrice's death? I think?
-   Many irregular things are happening. Miracles lol
-   _Beatrice_: It's difficult to corner a king with no wall to his back, and even more difficult to corner one with open spaces in all directions.
-   Don't stop thinking. Your unshaking will will bring you success with certainty
-   Beatrice, Ronove, and Kumasawa cannot think without permission from Natsuhi
    > Natsuhi said she was alone in the study
-   Who the fuck could Gaap be?
-   The demons/witches think having Kinzo go missing is the best strategy
    > Remember when Kyrie accosted Krauss back in episode 4? She laid out potential consequences if this happened
    > In other words, the other relatives probably have a contingency plan if Krauss/Natsuhi go through with this
-   Gaap can hide Goldsmith away in a world where no one will be able to find him
    > Might be worth paying attention to when they use Goldsmith vs Kinzo
-   Natsuhi is keeping Kinzo's disappearance as a last resort trump card

-   What does gouge mean exactly? Deleting a specific letter?
-   Erika and Battler are near... the well?
-   "The feel of it this time was clearly different from the previous times, as though some sort of device had activated"
-   _Erika_: The mistake 'you all' made was letting me on this island in the first place.
    > What's the now exposed contraption? Something about the well if I had to guess.
-   ERIKA CAN YOU NOT CALL YOURSELF AN INTELLECTUAL RAPIST WHO ENJOYS EXPOSING THINGS PEOPLE TRY TO HIDE
-   I ALSO ENJOY PROVING OTHER PEOPLE WRONG THROUGH **FACTS** AND **LOGIC** BUT LIKE COME ON
-   Battler notices a dim outdoor light and a silhouette of someone in front of it
-   Battler 'sees' Kinzo
-   Kinzo points to the signpost of the Golden Land
    > Once again, note that Battler was the only one who saw this. Nobody observed the contrary
-   'Kinzo' is calling it his epitaph. However, this Kinzo is dead. There might be more layers to this; it is Beatrice's game after all.
-   _Kinzo_: I have no more regrets in life!! Beatrice, I am coming to join you. Along with a present, the miracle chosen by my epitaph.
    > He has to be dead... right? It was never confirmed in red though...
    > And what does he mean by 'miracle chosen by my epitaph'? Is Battler going to die? What is the 'miracle' here?
-   _Kinzo_: BEATRICE! I'VE WON THIS BET!
    > The bet... was that someone would solve the epitaph? Kinzo bet on someone solving it. What did Beatrice have to prove by betting otherwise? What are the motivations here? What does someone learn by solving this epitaph?
    > More importantly, what does Kinzo gain for winning the bet? And what does Beatrice lose?
-   Erika and Battler find the gold, and it appears to be near the jail cell in Episode 4.
-   "If I could create a world where a full 100 humans wouldn't have to work for their entire lives, ...just what kind of world would that be...?"
-   Lambda had Bern hide the more 'central parts of it' i.e. the actual solving of the riddle...
    > Rude as hell...
-   In game 3, the gold discovery could be another cat box truth, since Eva and Rosa never discussed it w/anyone.
-   In other words, the gold might not exist. It could have just been an illusion...?
-   # This mountain of gold is real. All of the ingots piled up here are real, pure gold! There are absolutely no tricks such as replicas or fakes!!
-   Battler denies Kinzo's presence as magic with the blue, saying he was probably just excited after solving the riddle
-   Riddles are like locks, and there should be some goal in mind when unlocking them.

    > Gold discovered at about 10:45

-   Eva knocks on the door to the study
-   This is strange because Natsuhi ordered the servants to lock all the doors and windows after the relatives left for the guesthouse
    > Two possibilities here:
    >
    > > 1. The servants disobeyed her
    > > 2. Eva broke into the mansion somehow
    > >    Technically there's a third option: The servants forgot to lock a particular door. But that seems unlikely considering how particular they are
-   Sometimes, multiple schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.
-   Eva REALLY needs to talk to Kinzo. But why?
-   **Both of the keys to the study are in the study**
-   Looks like Battler and Erika solved the epitaph, and the relatives now know
-   The relatives forced themselves in after learning this. Krauss is going to pull Eva away from the study
    > This is really bad for Krauss & Natsuhi. The relatives are going to inevitably discover that Kinzo is dead now, since his presence is absolutely necessary now that the gold has been discovered
-   Natsuhi leaves the study... but does she have one of the keys?
    > The study might be completely inaccessible now.
-   waaaaaah we can't wake up kinzo no matter what
    > They are so FUCKED
-   The move of the demons that would sneer upon their efforts, had already begun
-   Battler and Erika solved the epitaph, but Erika forfeited her rights to the Golden Land.
    > Pretty interesting, Battler was previously the only one who didn't enter the Golden Land.
    > What the fuck is the Golden Land anyway? In episode 4 it was just a space for Beatrice and Maria
-   The deal was that Beatrice would stop the ceremony if the epitaph was solved.
-   Battler will not become the master of the Golden Land. So that means... there is no new Beatrice?
-   _Virgilia_: It has been several decades since we first manifested in the human world through our bond with Lord Goldsmith. ...The time since then has been very fun.
    > Pretty much confirms they're the servants right?
-   The demons are free now
-   Kinzo has been kicked down into Cocytus, the river of wailing in the underworld (Greek mythology)
-   Beatrice will continue working for Natsuhi. Something about witches not failing to show gratitude
-   Battler brought all of the adults, but none of the cousins
-   He wants to start the family conference
-   **The successor** gets another 10 billion in addition to the 2.5 billion. So that's 5/8 for the successor, and 1/8 for the other 3.
    > Who exactly is the successor though? There are two options: Natsuhi and Battler. Battler is the one who solved the epitaph with Erika, but Natsuhi's Kinzo ghost delusion insinuated that she was the proper head.
    > Battler has no interest in becoming the head though
-   Natsuhi is going back on her word and insinuating that the solver is not necessarily the head
    > Setting up for a motive, presumably...
-   Rosa suggests just asking Kinzo directly. Natsuhi what the fuck are you doing
-   Kyrie agrees.
    > Hey, attention keeps getting drawn to how ugly Battler finds all this arguing. This might be motivation for something.
    > One potential idea is that Battler becomes convinced the family is rotten to the core and goes one of two ways: The family needs to be destroyed, or he becomes enlightened like Ange.
    > He's not the detective this time, Erika is. So we don't need to doubt his potential for murder this time...
-   There's no way someone could move that much gold without being noticed, so they have no need to worry.
    > Seems like an opportunity for magic bullshit.
-   Having this mountain of gold is super distracting though
-   They're going to bribe Erika to keep quiet
    > She doesn't care
    > Poor Battler. He has to take part in this disgusting conference
-   # Some more thoughts
    > Maybe Beatrice didn't want anyone to solve the epitaph. That would be a decent explanation for the difficulty.
    > This begs the question, what is she trying to prove here? That the solver doesn't exist?
    > Ah... this might circle back to a Devil's Proof. Here's one random theory:
    > The epitaph is a bet between Kinzo and Beatrice. Two important things happened 6 and 19 years ago respectively:
    >
    > > Battler committed some sin, and Beatrice "died". I'm not certain about that second part, but I think it's true.
    > > Then the epitaph was created as Devil's Proof. Beatrice thinks the solver doesn't exist, but there's no way to completely deny their existence.
    > > Maybe Beatrice can't sleep in peace until the epitaph is properly solved? What's up with the solver gaining all her power and becoming the new Beatrice? This isn't just a succession test in Kinzo's sense, it's a succession test to become the new Golden Witch. What does being the Golden Witch even mean though?
    > > This has to tie into love somehow... Beatrice acknowledging the existence of a solver but not believing them herself... maybe it's like spurning Kinzo's love somehow...
    > > To put it more concisely, maybe there's some stupid bet like "if someone solves this you will come back to me" or whatever. That's all I can think of for now
-   # This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph.
    > Virgilia confirms that Beatrice is losing something here.
    > This is odd. Why would Beatrice ask them to solve the epitaph in the past then?
    > This seems self-destructive. Maybe she wants to be proven wrong really badly?
-   # The gold of the Golden Land belongs to this child. She had absolutely no need to make someone find it for her or to snatch it away herself
-   Battler says the murders make sense, they could be revenge against the family or a way for her to regain power.
-   # Whether the epitaph is solved at all, this child (Beatrice) has nothing to gain at all.
-   _Virgilia_: The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child.
    > The RIDDLE doesn't have any meaning. But what about the existence of a solution? These are two different things.
    > In other words, the riddle itself is immaterial. Beatrice wants to be proven wrong(?)
-   The epitaph's riddle and the massacre are equally significant in Beatrice's eyes
    > I think we can reword it like this:
    >
    > > Solve the epitaph, or else I will kill the entire family.
-   Battler is justifiably confused by the overcomplicated nature of the murders
    > I mean, yeah. She's making things harder for herself by doing it this way.
-   These are 'plotline murders'
-   Three potential reasons to follow the epitaph"
    1. Misconceptions about evidence and alibis can help the culprit. She could pretend to be dead and mix herself in with the victims, then commit the murders out of order to cause confusion.
    2. Coincidence
    3. Sowing fear (**this is only one that can work**)
-   Show the fear of death I guess
    > To who? WAIT...
    > Beatrice commits the murders to show a fear of death. That must mean... solving the epitaph means one of two things:
    >
    > > "I" am no longer scared of death, and never will be, provably
    > > "I" am scared of death, you don't need to make a display to convince me
    > > "I will not be scared of death, and neither should you (Beatrice). This would line up with the final line of the epitaph...
-   The culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.
    > This varied from game to game. Though, notably, it was Battler in episode 4.
-   Well, Battler is the one who consistently makes it to the last twilight. That much is pretty apparent...
-   # Battler is not the culprit. Battler did not kill anyone. This can be said of all games.
    > Right... but she's still trying to prove something to him. WHAT though? Is she trying to make him remember the sin from six years ago?
    > We have to think of it like this: The murders are committed to prove or show something to Battler. Solving the epitaph is evidence to Beatrice that this is unnecessary. How can these two ideas be reconciled?
-   # Her goal is not to make someone experience fear. And it isn't to have revenge on someone either.
    > She's trying to prove or show something, like I said.
-   _Battler_: What does she want from me that would be meaningless to her?
    > This might be the wrong way to look at it. There is meaning, but it comes from the consequences of her actions, not the actions themselves(?)
    > No, that's stupid. Well, maybe not. We'll see
    > Ah, the game itself confirmed my thinking. Cool.
-   > Let's think about the end of episode 4 again. Battler forgot his sin. Beatrice explicitly stated that everyone's deaths are a result of this particular sin. In other words, she carried them out because of it, implicitly.
    > We'll go with this. The sin is the reason the murders occur at all. And yet, solving the epitaph prevents the murders from occurring.
    > Since Beatrice isn't out for revenge, I think we can assume that solving the epitaph and the murders themselves are just some means to an end. Something is proven to her either way.
    > My best theory is that Battler's sin is proven to be remembered... but that can't be it. After all, the epitaph has been proven twice now and Battler still has no idea what he even did...
-   # Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure
