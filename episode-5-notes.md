# CURRENT STATUS:

-   First twilight hasn't occurred yet
-   Everyone is still alive
-   Maria is in the garden after Rosa went Rosa mode
-   The typhoon has arrived
-   Maria is searching for the rose

# [12-1-22]

-   She (Maria) is approached by an unknown person (Erika?) in the rose garden
-   _Genji_: Someone arrived at the mansion, claiming to have drifted here after an accident at sea\*
    > Is this believable? Note that the drifter is claiming this\*
-   Krauss and Natsuhi are being surprisingly accommodating
-   **ERIKA HAS ARRIVED**
-   Probs doesn't matter, but her boat was named Eternal Maid II and she arrived thanks to several miracles (Bern)
-   Erika is Bern as a game piece?
-   Beatrice cannot object to Erika's existence because she is a vegetal :(
-   # I (Bern) proclaim that Furudo Erika is the detective
-   # The detective isn't a culprit. No proof is needed to show this
    > Knox's 7th
-   _Lambda_: There was an exception clause in the original
    > Huh? What does she mean here?
-   # Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now
-   # She does not exist in the worlds before this one, nor does she influence them
-   # Furudo Erika only increases it by one person. Besides her, the number of people on this island is exactly the - same as it was in previous games
    > So there are 18 people. Kinzo is dead after all.
-   # Ths number of people in this parlor now is equal to the total number of people on this island
    > Again, 18. But that wasn't said in red.
-   Erika will borrow the bedroom next to the cousin's room on the 2nd floor of the guesthouse
-   Genji contacted the police and her family
    > VERY important to note that the police could actually be contacted at this time
-   She fell from a boat UNOBSERVED by the others on board
-   Bernkastel and Ronove appear and note that Erika **is a witch**
    > Random thoughts: Ronove is an analogue for Genji, and Virgilia transformed into Kumasawa back in Episode 3
    > Would it be possible for Beatrice to be Shannon's magical counterpart?
    > This might line up with something discussed on the beach back in Episode 3, where it was mentioned
    > Shannon was Battler's first love 6 years ago or whatever, and Shannon distinctly remembered everything
    > Also worth nothing that this is the Beatrice of the game board
-   _Beatrice_: Let's see how good Bern's next piece after Ange is
    > She's aware of Ange's existence in the prior game.
-   _Eva_: **Don't tell me you secretly called your illegitimate child to today's family conference, Rudolf?**
    > Okay, this is probably foreboding. I'm bolding this.
-   If you solve the epitaph, you can become the next Head

    > Remember, we're wondering why the epitaph is there to begin with.

    > **SHE SAID THE LINE**

-   _Erika_: By using deductive reasoning based upon my theory, it seems likely that Kinzo doesn't want the successor, Krauss, to inherit that position too smoothly

    > Please kill yourself

-   The sengoku commander Hideyoshi admired, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, made his son in law Hidegetsu commit seppuku
-   Rumored to have done this to make Hideyori, his real son, his true heir
-   _Erika_: If Kinzo wanted Krauss to be the successor, he wouldn't put out the epitaph like that for everyone to see
-   Maria brings up the golden land when asked what she'd do with 20 billion yen
-   Erika is about to solve the epitaph
-   Battler, Bern, and Lambda are dragged into fucked up nothing void universe
-   _Lambda_: You mustn't lose your purpose, you'll fall into the depths of eternity and become a scrap of ocean seaweed
    > This is what happened when Beatrice denied Battler's existence at the end of Episode 4
-   Fragments are fragments of worlds
    > Oh we're back to episode 3 when Eva solved the epitaph
-   _Evatrice_: The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations. The only past Father held dear happened in his childhood years.

-   The hometown isn't Odawara
-   Lambda ensured that there would be no explicit mention of the hometown
    > What do we know so far? It isn't Odawara.
    > Kinzo really likes Areca nuts. Specifically in relation to Vietnam, where they're a symbol of lovers/marriage
-   _Lambda_: If it wasn't a hard riddle, **there'd be no point to it**.

    > How is this a hint?
    > [1] The purpose of the riddle is intrinsically linked to its difficulty? So like a test?

    > We need to figure out the hometown.

    _Evatrice_: It didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it. If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget about it? Think of a river. A river. Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea.

    > What are some things that can flow through a hometown? Family tree is interesting. Maybe the moving of family?

    > Like, maybe the mansion is something to consider here. There's a flow of descendants that come and go.

-   Eva knew where the hometown was, so she ignored the sweetfish part. We don't know the hometown though.

    > Does this mean we need to focus on that part?

    > Okay... so not literal sweetfish, since we're not dealing with a literal river. What's so special about sweetfish?

-   Eva verified she was correct after going to the library and looking at... an atlas? And an encyclopedia?
    > Make sure we know what books she used. We can work backwards
-   As you travel down, you'll see a village
    > Eva had a flash of insight and realized what the village _could_ be
-   She questioned whether it would be "okay" if this was the answer.
    > Does this mean it involves a really fucked up or morally odd assumption?
-   The [village|shore|idk] does not have 6 characters. But there might be a way to read it with six characters.
    > Still pretty far off from finding the key itself though...
-   The key is six characters long.
    > The key chooses 6. The 6 in question are the characters of the key
-   By the first twilight, we have the 6 characters of the key, and some extra ones.
    > The two who are close... what could that mean?
    > Oh, we need to remove the key's characters from something that's AT LEAST 6 characters long. We don't need more keys...
    > That is one option. "The first twilight".
    > The second twilight says "tear apart the two who are close". What could this mean in an alphabetic context?
    > Maybe it means separating out two letters that aren't spaced out? But we still don't have a key...
    > f irst fi rst fir st t wilight twi light twil ight twili ght
-   Third twilight, praise my noble name
    > Insert "kinzo" somewhere?
    > Make it "look" like Kinzo somehow? Goldsmith?
-   Original list of characters is 11 or 13 characters long? In other words, subtract 6 to get 5 and be left with "Kinzo"?
-   > So this third twilight was like a way to check your work...
-   > Unless it's 13 characters long. In which case we need to crush the two characters instead of separating them
-   > One potential option is translating it to Thai: "S̄nṭhyā ræk" is 11 characters including the space
-   # ABOVE WAS REVEALED TO BE WRONG
-   **POSSIBLE LOCATIONS**
    -   China
    -   Korea
    -   Taiwan
    -   Hong Kong
    -   Vietnam

    -   Laos

    -   Philippines
    -   Singapore
    -   Myanmar
    -   Guam
-   If we assume that Kinzo wrote the epitaph, then the reasoning on [1] is sound. But what if Beato wrote it?
    > Beatrice WANTS them to solve the epitaph. She gains something from it. But why make it so hard then?
    > Let's think for a second. What does Beato gain by making it so difficult?
    > [2] Oh... we can think of it as a test again. She wants to find a particular person? The person she's looking for would be able to solve the epitaph.
    > But who exactly is she looking for, and why? And how is this connected to the sin Battler committed six years ago?
    > Kinzo died, Beatrice carried out his will as the alchemist, following the epitaph.
    > Eva is the only one who solved it, and she was the sole survivor of game 3. Well, more accurately, she murdered the only other person who solved it, and became the sole survivor. Was the gold a true motive? No, she must have had other reasons for doing so.
    > Basic idea: Beatrice carried out Kinzo's succession test, and Eva, naturally, became the new Head. But what does SHE gain for that? This was just an act of loyalty more than anything else
    > What other reasons could there be? Check line [2]

# [12-3-22]

-   _Rosa_: Instead of the first twilight, it's the tenth twilight that bugs me.
    > Probably referring to the "once and for the last time" part
    > What odd wording. It almost implies you can do it more than once, and that this has been done before.
-   _Rosa_: I've always thought that this 'first twilight' was nothing more than a place one-tenth of the way on a road to the Golden Land
    > This might not be a theory worth discarding yet.
-   The first twilight is the first stop on that ten-day journey
-   For this theory to bear any fruit, you need the start point and end point.
    > Maybe not. If we only know the start point, we can consider notable locations that are at most one day away.
-   _Rosa_: The place father spent his time when he was a boy really is far away. (NOT ODAWARA)
-   Battler leaves, sees Erika unlocking a door on his path **on the first floor**
-   _Erika_: I just wanted to search for something
    > OH IT'S THE LIBRARY FUCK SHE KNOWS
-   Erika pulls out an atlas to check her work.
-   The key is the first place you'd reach on a ten-day journey. We start from Kinzo's "hometown"

-   Someone probably suspects Kinzo's death
    > Ronove and Virgilia are in the study (Genji and Kumasawa)
    > Beatrice as well. (Shannon?)
-   _Virgilia_: We'll take Kinzo out of the study and have him tightrope walk from shadow to shadow where the toxin cannot reach
-   Natsuhi isn't a fan of repeating the same plan as last year
    > Note that Virgilia asks for permission from Natsuhi to execute the plan. Like she's a servant
-   _Natsuhi_: No one can determine the contents of a cat box that no number of people could ever hope to open
-   Man who mentioned taking revenge for the events of 19 years ago might be Bern's piece
    > The events are Beatrice's death? I think?
-   Many irregular things are happening. Miracles lol
-   _Beatrice_: It's difficult to corner a king with no wall to his back, and even more difficult to corner one with open spaces in all directions.
-   Don't stop thinking. Your unshaking will will bring you success with certainty
-   Beatrice, Ronove, and Kumasawa cannot think without permission from Natsuhi
    > Natsuhi said she was alone in the study
-   Who the fuck could Gaap be?
-   The demons/witches think having Kinzo go missing is the best strategy
    > Remember when Kyrie accosted Krauss back in episode 4? She laid out potential consequences if this happened
    > In other words, the other relatives probably have a contingency plan if Krauss/Natsuhi go through with this
-   Gaap can hide Goldsmith away in a world where no one will be able to find him
    > Might be worth paying attention to when they use Goldsmith vs Kinzo
-   Natsuhi is keeping Kinzo's disappearance as a last resort trump card

-   What does gouge mean exactly? Deleting a specific letter?
-   Erika and Battler are near... the well?
-   "The feel of it this time was clearly different from the previous times, as though some sort of device had activated"
-   _Erika_: The mistake 'you all' made was letting me on this island in the first place.
    > What's the now exposed contraption? Something about the well if I had to guess.
-   ERIKA CAN YOU NOT CALL YOURSELF AN INTELLECTUAL RAPIST WHO ENJOYS EXPOSING THINGS PEOPLE TRY TO HIDE
-   I ALSO ENJOY PROVING OTHER PEOPLE WRONG THROUGH **FACTS** AND **LOGIC** BUT LIKE COME ON
-   Battler notices a dim outdoor light and a silhouette of someone in front of it
-   Battler 'sees' Kinzo
-   Kinzo points to the signpost of the Golden Land
    > Once again, note that Battler was the only one who saw this. Nobody observed the contrary
-   'Kinzo' is calling it his epitaph. However, this Kinzo is dead. There might be more layers to this; it is Beatrice's game after all.
-   _Kinzo_: I have no more regrets in life!! Beatrice, I am coming to join you. Along with a present, the miracle chosen by my epitaph.
    > He has to be dead... right? It was never confirmed in red though...
    > And what does he mean by 'miracle chosen by my epitaph'? Is Battler going to die? What is the 'miracle' here?
-   _Kinzo_: BEATRICE! I'VE WON THIS BET!
    > The bet... was that someone would solve the epitaph? Kinzo bet on someone solving it. What did Beatrice have to prove by betting otherwise? What are the motivations here? What does someone learn by solving this epitaph?
    > More importantly, what does Kinzo gain for winning the bet? And what does Beatrice lose?
-   Erika and Battler find the gold, and it appears to be near the jail cell in Episode 4.
-   "If I could create a world where a full 100 humans wouldn't have to work for their entire lives, ...just what kind of world would that be...?"
-   Lambda had Bern hide the more 'central parts of it' i.e. the actual solving of the riddle...
    > Rude as hell...
-   In game 3, the gold discovery could be another cat box truth, since Eva and Rosa never discussed it w/anyone.
-   In other words, the gold might not exist. It could have just been an illusion...?
-   # This mountain of gold is real. All of the ingots piled up here are real, pure gold! There are absolutely no tricks such as replicas or fakes!!
-   Battler denies Kinzo's presence as magic with the blue, saying he was probably just excited after solving the riddle
-   Riddles are like locks, and there should be some goal in mind when unlocking them.

    > Gold discovered at about 10:45

-   Eva knocks on the door to the study
-   This is strange because Natsuhi ordered the servants to lock all the doors and windows after the relatives left for the guesthouse
    > Two possibilities here:
    >
    > > 1. The servants disobeyed her
    > > 2. Eva broke into the mansion somehow
    > >    Technically there's a third option: The servants forgot to lock a particular door. But that seems unlikely considering how particular they are
-   Sometimes, multiple schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.
-   Eva REALLY needs to talk to Kinzo. But why?
-   **Both of the keys to the study are in the study**
-   Looks like Battler and Erika solved the epitaph, and the relatives now know
-   The relatives forced themselves in after learning this. Krauss is going to pull Eva away from the study
    > This is really bad for Krauss & Natsuhi. The relatives are going to inevitably discover that Kinzo is dead now, since his presence is absolutely necessary now that the gold has been discovered
-   Natsuhi leaves the study... but does she have one of the keys?
    > The study might be completely inaccessible now.
-   waaaaaah we can't wake up kinzo no matter what
    > They are so FUCKED
-   The move of the demons that would sneer upon their efforts, had already begun
-   Battler and Erika solved the epitaph, but Erika forfeited her rights to the Golden Land.
    > Pretty interesting, Battler was previously the only one who didn't enter the Golden Land.
    > What the fuck is the Golden Land anyway? In episode 4 it was just a space for Beatrice and Maria
-   The deal was that Beatrice would stop the ceremony if the epitaph was solved.
-   Battler will not become the master of the Golden Land. So that means... there is no new Beatrice?
-   _Virgilia_: It has been several decades since we first manifested in the human world through our bond with Lord Goldsmith. ...The time since then has been very fun.
    > Pretty much confirms they're the servants right?
-   The demons are free now
-   Kinzo has been kicked down into Cocytus, the river of wailing in the underworld (Greek mythology)
-   Beatrice will continue working for Natsuhi. Something about witches not failing to show gratitude
-   Battler brought all of the adults, but none of the cousins
-   He wants to start the family conference
-   **The successor** gets another 10 billion in addition to the 2.5 billion. So that's 5/8 for the successor, and 1/8 for the other 3.
    > Who exactly is the successor though? There are two options: Natsuhi and Battler. Battler is the one who solved the epitaph with Erika, but Natsuhi's Kinzo ghost delusion insinuated that she was the proper head.
    > Battler has no interest in becoming the head though
-   Natsuhi is going back on her word and insinuating that the solver is not necessarily the head
    > Setting up for a motive, presumably...
-   Rosa suggests just asking Kinzo directly. Natsuhi what the fuck are you doing
-   Kyrie agrees.
    > Hey, attention keeps getting drawn to how ugly Battler finds all this arguing. This might be motivation for something.
    > One potential idea is that Battler becomes convinced the family is rotten to the core and goes one of two ways: The family needs to be destroyed, or he becomes enlightened like Ange.
    > He's not the detective this time, Erika is. So we don't need to doubt his potential for murder this time...
-   There's no way someone could move that much gold without being noticed, so they have no need to worry.
    > Seems like an opportunity for magic bullshit.
-   Having this mountain of gold is super distracting though
-   They're going to bribe Erika to keep quiet
    > She doesn't care
    > Poor Battler. He has to take part in this disgusting conference
-   # Some more thoughts
    > Maybe Beatrice didn't want anyone to solve the epitaph. That would be a decent explanation for the difficulty.
    > This begs the question, what is she trying to prove here? That the solver doesn't exist?
    > Ah... this might circle back to a Devil's Proof. Here's one random theory:
    > The epitaph is a bet between Kinzo and Beatrice. Two important things happened 6 and 19 years ago respectively:
    >
    > > Battler committed some sin, and Beatrice "died". I'm not certain about that second part, but I think it's true.
    > > Then the epitaph was created as Devil's Proof. Beatrice thinks the solver doesn't exist, but there's no way to completely deny their existence.
    > > Maybe Beatrice can't sleep in peace until the epitaph is properly solved? What's up with the solver gaining all her power and becoming the new Beatrice? This isn't just a succession test in Kinzo's sense, it's a succession test to become the new Golden Witch. What does being the Golden Witch even mean though?
    > > This has to tie into love somehow... Beatrice acknowledging the existence of a solver but not believing them herself... maybe it's like spurning Kinzo's love somehow...
    > > To put it more concisely, maybe there's some stupid bet like "if someone solves this you will come back to me" or whatever. That's all I can think of for now
-   # This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph.
    > Virgilia confirms that Beatrice is losing something here.
    > This is odd. Why would Beatrice ask them to solve the epitaph in the past then?
    > This seems self-destructive. Maybe she wants to be proven wrong really badly?
-   # The gold of the Golden Land belongs to this child. She had absolutely no need to make someone find it for her or to snatch it away herself
-   Battler says the murders make sense, they could be revenge against the family or a way for her to regain power.
-   # Whether the epitaph is solved at all, this child (Beatrice) has nothing to gain at all.
-   _Virgilia_: The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child.
    > The RIDDLE doesn't have any meaning. But what about the existence of a solution? These are two different things.
    > In other words, the riddle itself is immaterial. Beatrice wants to be proven wrong(?)
-   The epitaph's riddle and the massacre are equally significant in Beatrice's eyes
    > I think we can reword it like this:
    >
    > > Solve the epitaph, or else I will kill the entire family.
-   Battler is justifiably confused by the overcomplicated nature of the murders
    > I mean, yeah. She's making things harder for herself by doing it this way.
-   These are 'plotline murders'
-   Three potential reasons to follow the epitaph"
    1. Misconceptions about evidence and alibis can help the culprit. She could pretend to be dead and mix herself in with the victims, then commit the murders out of order to cause confusion.
    2. Coincidence
    3. Sowing fear (**this is only one that can work**)
-   Show the fear of death I guess
    > To who? WAIT...
    > Beatrice commits the murders to show a fear of death. That must mean... solving the epitaph means one of two things:
    >
    > > "I" am no longer scared of death, and never will be, provably
    > > "I" am scared of death, you don't need to make a display to convince me
    > > "I will not be scared of death, and neither should you (Beatrice). This would line up with the final line of the epitaph...
-   The culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.
    > This varied from game to game. Though, notably, it was Battler in episode 4.
-   Well, Battler is the one who consistently makes it to the last twilight. That much is pretty apparent...
-   # Battler is not the culprit. Battler did not kill anyone. This can be said of all games.
    > Right... but she's still trying to prove something to him. WHAT though? Is she trying to make him remember the sin from six years ago?
    > We have to think of it like this: The murders are committed to prove or show something to Battler. Solving the epitaph is evidence to Beatrice that this is unnecessary. How can these two ideas be reconciled?
-   # Her goal is not to make someone experience fear. And it isn't to have revenge on someone either.
    > She's trying to prove or show something, like I said.
-   _Battler_: What does she want from me that would be meaningless to her?

    > This might be the wrong way to look at it. There is meaning, but it comes from the consequences of her actions, not the actions themselves(?)

    > No, that's stupid. Well, maybe not. We'll see

    > Ah, the game itself confirmed my thinking. Cool.

    > Let's think about the end of episode 4 again. Battler forgot his sin. Beatrice explicitly stated that everyone's deaths are a result of this particular sin. In other words, she carried them out because of it, implicitly.

    > We'll go with this. The sin is the reason the murders occur at all. And yet, solving the epitaph prevents the murders from occurring.

    > Since Beatrice isn't out for revenge, I think we can assume that solving the epitaph and the murders themselves are just some means to an end. Something is proven to her either way.

    > My best theory is that Battler's sin is proven to be remembered... but that can't be it. After all, the epitaph has been proven twice now and Battler still has no idea what he even did...

    # Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure

# [12-4-22]

-   _Battler_: Next time you want to write a love letter, I suggest you just write 'I love you'. If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out.

    > This is all... a love letter? How?

    > I can see one reasonable way to look at this. Solving the epitaph proves that Battler(?) loves Beatrice but failing to solve it proves otherwise? Idk

-   "It was never specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the solver"
-   The adults decide that the conference needs to be recorded, so Rudolf pulls out a tape set.

    > Forgery is impossible with this

    > Somehow I doubt that

-   Kinzo listens to a lot of "sophisticated" music apparently
-   Kanon and Shannon come in with black tea
    _Kyrie_: Become sacrifices for us now that we crave something to talk about
-   Unknown individual knocks on the door to the conference as the clock strikes 24:00

    > Erika? That seems to be the only possibility here. The cousins are definitely out of the question.

-   Krauss and Natsuhi are discussing their options, since they essentially have none whatsoever.
-   Natsuhi thinks they should arrange for Genji to tell everyone that Kinzo went for a walk in the forest early in the morning. Arrange for his room to be 'empty'
-   Krauss doubts this plan's effectiveness because Eva and the others will label them as suspicious
    _Krauss_: There's nothing wrong with persisting until the last possible second tomorrow. If we're able to make it through safely, we won't have to lose anything. There's no need to get impatient and use that trump card
    > So Natsuhi is prepared to make Kinzo disappear now. She's willing to tank the social damage
-   Natsuhi has **both** of the keys to the study in her possession.
    _Krauss_: Let's wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card. It's like a last-resort treasured sword. It's best when it remains in its sheath.
    > Ah, like the red truth.
-   Another phone call comes for Natsuhi.
    > The same "Battler" (not Battler) again?
-   This man wants revenge for what happened 19 years ago. This was precisely one year before Jessica and Battler were born.
-   Natsuhi's life didn't really begin until Jessica was born
-   Something from the last year of that hateful period is speaking vengeful words from the other end of the phone
-   Decides to transfer the call to her room. Tells Krauss she's going to bed, then locks the door
-   There's no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room... at least that's what she told herself.
-   Once again, the man calls her mother.
    > I find it hard to believe that Natsuhi is this person's actual mother. Like, how do you hide a pregnancy for that long? It's possible she cheated on Krauss at some point, but she can't hide something like a pregnancy.
-   The man knows about her headache. He also knows she's getting sick of the family conference.

    > So this probably has to be someone familiar with the Ushiromiya family.

    > It's also worth noting that Battler is not Asumu's child. Furthermore, we can't necessarily trust the information being given here.

    > Here's a theory: Jessica and Battler's mothers are inverted. In other words, Battler is Natsuhi's child, and Jessica is Asumu's. That would solve the troublesome red from the end of episode 4 and give a plausible idea for what the sin from 19 years ago could be.

    > But who the hell is this person?

-   _Guy_: Your name is Natsuhi. It has the kanji for a season (夏) in it. Pretty nice name
-   Natsuhi's favorite season is autumn, not summer as the kanji suggests
-   "because it's easy to pass time in. no other reason"
    > Ok
-   12:07 AM, the man asks about the clock in her room. Why does he know about it?
    > He has either been in there before, or someone told him
-   Threatens to tell Krauss and Jessica about what happened 19 years ago

    > If Natsuhi has a clear conscience, she wouldn't care about this

    > So something probably happened

-   Natsuhi lifts the clock and finds a playing card
    > What the hell is this? Something that makes her happy...?
-   _Guy_: How dare you act like a normal, neat-freak mother. You make me want to vomit, murderer. Do you want that to land on your husband and daughter as well?
-   My wounds could not be healed with any amount of money. But there is a medicine.
    > Maybe Natsuhi gave birth to someone before Jessica and he was discarded for whatever reason?
-   The only medicine is my hatred.
    > This guy is like a fail Ange
-   The guy is at the family conference. And he hates Natsuhi because of something that happened 19 years ago.
    > He sounds like Battler, but he probably isn't
-   He knows who Erika is, and he could have come here before the typhoon
-   _Guy_: I will not appear in front of anyone until you introduce me. It is useless to try and search for me. Unless you want to expose me and introduce me to everyone? Introduce me to Jessica too. **Tell her I am her older brother by one year**.
-   Guy is forcing Natsuhi to stay in the room for the rest of the night and sleep
    > Either giving her an alibi for the first twilight, or drawing suspicion to her
-   The card had the kanji for autumn, and some pattern like a tarot card

    > What could this be?

    > Could this mysterious individual have planted it there?

-   Knock at the door to the conference, nobody knows who it was. Envelope appears there
-   The envelopes are in the study. Natsuhi has both of the keys.
    > Someone would need access to it before she got the keys, which was just after the gold was discovered
-   Letter from Beatrice acknowledges that he gets the gold and is the new Head
    > Was Kinzo's ring on his corpse when he died?
    > Who had it, if it wasn't?
-   Supposedly, Krauss couldn't have left it.
    > We don't know that for sure. I mean, by doing this, he could have diverted pressure from himself and avoid his embezzlement from being discovered.
-   Fast-forward to 3:05 AM
-   Conference continued until then. No actual conclusion was reached. People just argued about bullshit
-   Gohda, Nanjo, and Erika are still awake
-   Rosa returned to the guesthouse at 1:00 AM and immediately went to bed
-   Rudolf wants to talk about something important tomorrow. It's about Battler.
    > Almost certainly about how Battler isn't Asumu's kid
-   "If I tell you about this, I'll probably be killed."
-   "It's about your birth."
    > Yep, called it.
-   Kinzo gave up on Natsuhi and started donating to many charities
-   One was the Fukuin House, where many pieces of "furniture" came from
-   Kinzo employed kids from there with exceptional grades as servants

    > Wait... I thought Kanon said he wasn't educated?

    > It's worth doubting Kinzo's supposed intentions here

-   Shannon, Kanon, Lunon, Manon, Leion.
-   Supposedly, Kinzo wanted to empower these servants and spread their wings in society
-   _Beatrice_: I see. So, an adopted child...

    > Alright, I understand now. Natsuhi didn't give birth to someone other than Jessica, just as I originally suspected. Rather, her desire to become a mother made her adopt a servant, and the man over the phone must be said servant.

    > This would explain how he knows the layout of the mansion.

    > Natsuhi must have... fired him? Discarded him somehow. Maybe because she finally became pregnant, and made it clear that he was just a placeholder until she could actually have her own child.

    > Oh nevermind.

# [12-5-22]

-   Kinzo ordered Natsuhi to raise a baby as her own, in order to succeed Krauss.
-   Natsuhi hated her body, not Kinzo.
-   Gives the baby to an older servant because she didn't like the crying.
    -   Wanted the servant to take the baby far away, and never return
    -   Servant takes the baby to the cliff Ange was at in episode 4
    -   Supposedly, a demon lured the servant there
    -   Then the servant and baby fell off the cliff
        > Worth noting that this is the second time characters have died this way
-   _Beatrice_: You are sinless. Humans are sinless. You can even say that I killed them. No, I did kill them!

    > Interesting. She's trying to take responsibility and absolve Natsuhi.

    > This is hard to explain, but maybe Beatrice is some kind of "entity" on which to blame catastrophes like these?

-   _Ronove_: If you can't accept it as an accident, blame it on us. That's why demons exist.
-   Beatrice begins to weave a story where she lured the servant and baby to the cliff

    > I am less concerned with why she's doing this, and more so questioning what is actually happening here. Whose thoughts are these, and who's trying to prove themselves innocent?

    > I imagine this wasn't just some freak accident. If it was, then why would this vengeful stranger be so... vengeful?

-   Beatrice lured them into the Golden Land and Gaap gapped them into the air, killing both

    > So Gaap is just a way of showcasing falls? I guess that makes sense. We'll need to contextualize her other appearances using this.

    > General idea is this: Beatrice lured them (not really, they were probably lured or forced to go by Natsuhi) then Gaap made them fall to their deaths. But that was just the cliff

-   _Natsuhi_: When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, I went pale.
    > We can question why she was there in the first place, but judging by Kinzo's response, I'm not sure Natsuhi actually did anything.
-   _Kinzo_: How long will you struggle? How long will it be before you're mine? I have no interest in an empty cage. Throw it away!
    > Does the empty cage refer to the baby? I'm fairly certain he's referring to an empty vessel for Beatrice, but what does the baby have to do with that?
-   Beatrice definitely killed the baby **in the magic world**. However, you might find out that it's alive in the world of Humans. Whether it's really **alive or not**, right?
-   Erika is Bern's piece. Whose piece is the man from 19 years ago then?

    > Once again, if Natsuhi had nothing to hide, why would this man be so confident?

    > Not to put her in a Kafka trap, but I doubt this man would have such an iron grip over her if he didn't actually have some huge sin to expose.

-   Turns out Lambda was the one calling. What?
    > Her intention was to keep Natsuhi from leaving her room that night. Giving her an alibi, I guess. Or somehow drawing suspicion to her.
-   _Bern_: Both Natsuhi and Beato are like the guts of a filthy truth wrapped up in a bit of thin skin. Tearing that to bits and dragging the insides out is one of our few pleasures.
    > She's basically saying that she likes to solve mysteries. She's just a little gross about it.
-   Beatrice's piece is going to be sacrificed
-   Lambda and Bern have totally taken over the game, and they aren't going to utilize Beatrice or her furniture as actual pieces anymore. Just pins.
-   Furthermore, it was outright stated that Beatrice was just an illusion. Not that the confirmation was necessary.
    > Really have to wonder what Beatrice was trying to do here. She truly wanted to show Battler something, and I guess 4 attempts was enough to make her give up. Battler still doesn't understand what he's trying to tell her.
-   This tale was supposed to be one that Beatrice invited Battler to see. But the host has been lost, and there are no longer any guests. Neither are around in this horrible tale.
    > So I guess this is why it's called Answer Arcs. Bern is just going to rip apart all the illusions.

# October 5th, 1986; 7:00 AM

-   Probs not important, but the games were probably playing Sevens with the cards.

# FIRST TWILIGHT BEGINS

-   George is found dead in his bed
-   Neck split wide open
-   Maria, Jessica, and Rosa died similarly. Rosa was in Maria's bed.
-   No other wounds on any of the cadavers
    > Also worth noting that Natsuhi has an alibi... probably. I doubt she left her room.

# _Erika_: Detective's Authority. The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes. Stand back, Ushiromiya Battler. This is an official privilege of this game, which the human side has accepted.

-   Kanon fell asleep in the servant room and never saw Genji between that time, and about 8 the next morning
-   A small strip of packing tape was stuck along the frame of the door to the servant waiting room, almost as though it was sealing the door shut.
-   Furthermore, there were notches made with scissors along the center of the packing tape, so that if you opened the door only a slight amount, it would be torn apart.
-   There was also a signature written across the packing tape in thin pen. It's too intricate to determine whose it is.
    > Why would someone even write their signature on the tape? Maybe someone wanted to frame another person?
    > Does the tape say something when ripped apart along the notches?
-   Genji died the same way. Belphegor notes that you need a long blade to make a cut this deep.

    > Wait wait wait wait. The stakes correspond to other people here. Let's remember the first 4 murders:
    > **STAKES PRESENT**: Mammon, Asmodeus, and Satan. The three people there were Eva, Hideyoshi, and Nanjo. I don't really know who corresponds to who, but what really matters is...

    > Belphegor was told to report to Lucifer, and then Kumasawa dashed out. The one who asked her to do so was Leviathan, and Kanon was the only other one there.

-   There was a clunking, clattering noise, as though it was taking a lot of effort to hand the receiver over.

    > It really shouldn't be that difficult, right?

    > Unless... this isn't a proper phone call.

    > The clunking and clattering could have been someone swapping out tapes in a tape deck, with a receiver just being held. In other words, this is just a recording being played back. That would also explain why Krauss didn't respond to her voice.

    > Let's go with that. If this is the case, then I see two options here:
    >
    > > Krauss recorded those lines intentionally, without being tied up at all
    > > Krauss was actually tied up at some point and recorded

    > I mean, those things are obvious. But the first one implies he's complicit in something. Who does that, after all?

    > The motive would also be pretty clear. After all, he has every reason to try and murder everyone off to save his ass.

-   His eyes and ears are covered, so you won't be able to talk.
    > Hmm... okay.
-   Two conditions given to Natsuhi:
    1. Do not tell anyone that he has Krauss
    2. At 1:00 today, go to the foremost guest room on the 1st floor of the mansion and hide in the closet. If you can hide there for an hour without anyone finding you, you win.
-   It doesn't really matter if she's found. She needs to play along for Krauss' safety to be guaranteed.

    > Why such a specific amount of time? Some murder is going to happen and an alibi needs to be secured?

    > Wait... this is more justification for Krauss being behind everything. He's trying to give Natsuhi alibis so she can avoid suspicion!

    > It's been established that this is Lambda's piece. Erika started off the chapter by claiming that Natsuhi was the culprit. That might have been an incorrect claim, and Lambda's moves here are securing Natsuhi's innocence.

-   Rokkenjima has been cut off from the outside world, and the closed circle has been completed. **The authority of the detective piece is totally guaranteed**.
-   Everyone has been accounted for in the parlor **except** for Krauss (and Kinzo, but y'know)
-   No 19th person can exist on this island. So it's not possible for the unknown man to exist.
    > So who is he? He would need to be one of the 18. (It could still be Erika. The only stipulation was that the detective cannot be the culprit. There's no evidence that the man is the culprit)
-   Krauss's room was empty. The bed was too, but massive bloodstains similar to the other crime scenes remained.
    > This further supports that tape theory. He was likely recorded, then murdered.
-   No corpse for Krauss. We can't be sure he's dead.
    > There's also ths possibility that this blood wasn't his.
-   Krauss's door was unlocked. This is unusual.
-   Keys don't really matter. Genji's master key is missing. Locks don't matter.

-   Everyone returns to the guesthouse and discovers that **all 4 corpses have gone missing**.

    > Krauss is the only one truly unaccounted for. Furthermore, we know the culprit (in this instance) must have Genji's master key.

    > Let's commit to that theory about Krauss's blood not belonging to him. It definitely would have been possible for him to perform the murders and carry off the 4 corpses using the master key from Genji.

    > Another important note: Krauss mentioned a trump card last night... likening it to a treasured sword. Awfully similar to the hypothetical murder weapon.

    > ONE MORE THING: Krauss is one of the few people who actually knows what happened 19 years ago.
