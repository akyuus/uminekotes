# CURRENT STATUS:

-   First twilight hasn't occurred yet
-   Everyone is still alive
-   Maria is in the garden after Rosa went Rosa mode
-   The typhoon has arrived
-   Maria is searching for the rose

# [12-1-22]

-   She (Maria) is approached by an unknown person (Erika?) in the rose garden
-   _Genji_: Someone arrived at the mansion, claiming to have drifted here after an accident at sea\*
    > Is this believable? Note that the drifter is claiming this\*
-   Krauss and Natsuhi are being surprisingly accommodating
-   **ERIKA HAS ARRIVED**
-   Probs doesn't matter, but her boat was named Eternal Maid II and she arrived thanks to several miracles (Bern)
-   Erika is Bern as a game piece?
-   Beatrice cannot object to Erika's existence because she is a vegetal :(
-   # I (Bern) proclaim that Furudo Erika is the detective
-   # The detective isn't a culprit. No proof is needed to show this
    > Knox's 7th
-   _Lambda_: There was an exception clause in the original
    > Huh? What does she mean here?
-   # Furudo Erika had no influence on any of Beato's games before now
-   # She does not exist in the worlds before this one, nor does she influence them
-   # Furudo Erika only increases it by one person. Besides her, the number of people on this island is exactly the - same as it was in previous games
    > So there are 18 people. Kinzo is dead after all.
-   # Ths number of people in this parlor now is equal to the total number of people on this island
    > Again, 18. But that wasn't said in red.
-   Erika will borrow the bedroom next to the cousin's room on the 2nd floor of the guesthouse
-   Genji contacted the police and her family
    > VERY important to note that the police could actually be contacted at this time
-   She fell from a boat UNOBSERVED by the others on board
-   Bernkastel and Ronove appear and note that Erika **is a witch**
    > Random thoughts: Ronove is an analogue for Genji, and Virgilia transformed into Kumasawa back in Episode 3
    > Would it be possible for Beatrice to be Shannon's magical counterpart?
    > This might line up with something discussed on the beach back in Episode 3, where it was mentioned
    > Shannon was Battler's first love 6 years ago or whatever, and Shannon distinctly remembered everything
    > Also worth nothing that this is the Beatrice of the game board
-   _Beatrice_: Let's see how good Bern's next piece after Ange is
    > She's aware of Ange's existence in the prior game.
-   _Eva_: **Don't tell me you secretly called your illegitimate child to today's family conference, Rudolf?**
    > Okay, this is probably foreboding. I'm bolding this.
-   If you solve the epitaph, you can become the next Head

    > Remember, we're wondering why the epitaph is there to begin with.

    > **SHE SAID THE LINE**

-   _Erika_: By using deductive reasoning based upon my theory, it seems likely that Kinzo doesn't want the successor, Krauss, to inherit that position too smoothly

    > Please kill yourself

-   The sengoku commander Hideyoshi admired, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, made his son in law Hidegetsu commit seppuku
-   Rumored to have done this to make Hideyori, his real son, his true heir
-   _Erika_: If Kinzo wanted Krauss to be the successor, he wouldn't put out the epitaph like that for everyone to see
-   Maria brings up the golden land when asked what she'd do with 20 billion yen
-   Erika is about to solve the epitaph
-   Battler, Bern, and Lambda are dragged into fucked up nothing void universe
-   _Lambda_: You mustn't lose your purpose, you'll fall into the depths of eternity and become a scrap of ocean seaweed
    > This is what happened when Beatrice denied Battler's existence at the end of Episode 4
-   Fragments are fragments of worlds
    > Oh we're back to episode 3 when Eva solved the epitaph
-   _Evatrice_: The 'beloved hometown' definitely won't betray our expectations. The only past Father held dear happened in his childhood years.

-   The hometown isn't Odawara
-   Lambda ensured that there would be no explicit mention of the hometown
    > What do we know so far? It isn't Odawara.
    > Kinzo really likes Areca nuts. Specifically in relation to Vietnam, where they're a symbol of lovers/marriage
-   _Lambda_: If it wasn't a hard riddle, **there'd be no point to it**.

    > How is this a hint?
    > [1] The purpose of the riddle is intrinsically linked to its difficulty? So like a test?

    > We need to figure out the hometown.

    _Evatrice_: It didn't have to be a river with water flowing down it. If the word sweetfish is too complicated, why not forget about it? Think of a river. A river. Linking it with a 'family tree' wasn't a bad idea.

    > What are some things that can flow through a hometown? Family tree is interesting. Maybe the moving of family?

    > Like, maybe the mansion is something to consider here. There's a flow of descendants that come and go.

-   Eva knew where the hometown was, so she ignored the sweetfish part. We don't know the hometown though.

    > Does this mean we need to focus on that part?

    > Okay... so not literal sweetfish, since we're not dealing with a literal river. What's so special about sweetfish?

-   Eva verified she was correct after going to the library and looking at... an atlas? And an encyclopedia?
    > Make sure we know what books she used. We can work backwards
-   As you travel down, you'll see a village
    > Eva had a flash of insight and realized what the village _could_ be
-   She questioned whether it would be "okay" if this was the answer.
    > Does this mean it involves a really fucked up or morally odd assumption?
-   The [village|shore|idk] does not have 6 characters. But there might be a way to read it with six characters.
    > Still pretty far off from finding the key itself though...
-   The key is six characters long.
    > The key chooses 6. The 6 in question are the characters of the key
-   By the first twilight, we have the 6 characters of the key, and some extra ones.
    > The two who are close... what could that mean?
    > Oh, we need to remove the key's characters from something that's AT LEAST 6 characters long. We don't need more keys...
    > That is one option. "The first twilight".
    > The second twilight says "tear apart the two who are close". What could this mean in an alphabetic context?
    > Maybe it means separating out two letters that aren't spaced out? But we still don't have a key...
    > f irst fi rst fir st t wilight twi light twil ight twili ght
-   Third twilight, praise my noble name
    > Insert "kinzo" somewhere?
    > Make it "look" like Kinzo somehow? Goldsmith?
-   Original list of characters is 11 or 13 characters long? In other words, subtract 6 to get 5 and be left with "Kinzo"?
-   > So this third twilight was like a way to check your work...
-   > Unless it's 13 characters long. In which case we need to crush the two characters instead of separating them
-   > One potential option is translating it to Thai: "S̄nṭhyā ræk" is 11 characters including the space
-   # ABOVE WAS REVEALED TO BE WRONG
-   **POSSIBLE LOCATIONS**
    -   China
    -   Korea

-   If we assume that Kinzo wrote the epitaph, then the reasoning on [1] is sound. But what if Beato wrote it?
    > Beatrice WANTS them to solve the epitaph. She gains something from it. But why make it so hard then?
    > Let's think for a second. What does Beato gain by making it so difficult?
    > [2] Oh... we can think of it as a test again. She wants to find a particular person? The person she's looking for would be able to solve the epitaph.
    > But who exactly is she looking for, and why? And how is this connected to the sin Battler committed six years ago?
    > Kinzo died, Beatrice carried out his will as the alchemist, following the epitaph.
    > Eva is the only one who solved it, and she was the sole survivor of game 3. Well, more accurately, she murdered the only other person who solved it, and became the sole survivor. Was the gold a true motive? No, she must have had other reasons for doing so.
    > Basic idea: Beatrice carried out Kinzo's succession test, and Eva, naturally, became the new Head. But what does SHE gain for that? This was just an act of loyalty more than anything else
    > What other reasons could there be? Check line [2]

# [12-3-22]

-   _Rosa_: Instead of the first twilight, it's the tenth twilight that bugs me.
    > Probably referring to the "once and for the last time" part
    > What odd wording. It almost implies you can do it more than once, and that this has been done before.
-   _Rosa_: I've always thought that this 'first twilight' was nothing more than a place one-tenth of the way on a road to the Golden Land
    > This might not be a theory worth discarding yet.
-   The first twilight is the first stop on that ten-day journey
-   For this theory to bear any fruit, you need the start point and end point.
    > Maybe not. If we only know the start point, we can consider notable locations that are at most one day away.
-   _Rosa_: The place father spent his time when he was a boy really is far away. (NOT ODAWARA)
-   Battler leaves, sees Erika unlocking a door on his path **on the first floor**
-   _Erika_: I just wanted to search for something
    > OH IT'S THE LIBRARY FUCK SHE KNOWS
-   Erika pulls out an atlas to check her work.
-   The key is the first place you'd reach on a ten-day journey. We start from Kinzo's "hometown"

-   Someone probably suspects Kinzo's death
    > Ronove and Virgilia are in the study (Genji and Kumasawa)
    > Beatrice as well. (Shannon?)
-   _Virgilia_: We'll take Kinzo out of the study and have him tightrope walk from shadow to shadow where the toxin cannot reach
-   Natsuhi isn't a fan of repeating the same plan as last year
    > Note that Virgilia asks for permission from Natsuhi to execute the plan. Like she's a servant
-   _Natsuhi_: No one can determine the contents of a cat box that no number of people could ever hope to open
-   Man who mentioned taking revenge for the events of 19 years ago might be Bern's piece
    > The events are Beatrice's death? I think?
-   Many irregular things are happening. Miracles lol
-   _Beatrice_: It's difficult to corner a king with no wall to his back, and even more difficult to corner one with open spaces in all directions.
-   Don't stop thinking. Your unshaking will will bring you success with certainty
-   Beatrice, Ronove, and Kumasawa cannot think without permission from Natsuhi
    > Natsuhi said she was alone in the study
-   Who the fuck could Gaap be?
-   The demons/witches think having Kinzo go missing is the best strategy
    > Remember when Kyrie accosted Krauss back in episode 4? She laid out potential consequences if this happened
    > In other words, the other relatives probably have a contingency plan if Krauss/Natsuhi go through with this
-   Gaap can hide Goldsmith away in a world where no one will be able to find him
    > Might be worth paying attention to when they use Goldsmith vs Kinzo
-   Natsuhi is keeping Kinzo's disappearance as a last resort trump card

-   What does gouge mean exactly? Deleting a specific letter?
-   Erika and Battler are near... the well?
-   "The feel of it this time was clearly different from the previous times, as though some sort of device had activated"
-   _Erika_: The mistake 'you all' made was letting me on this island in the first place.
    > What's the now exposed contraption? Something about the well if I had to guess.
-   ERIKA CAN YOU NOT CALL YOURSELF AN INTELLECTUAL RAPIST WHO ENJOYS EXPOSING THINGS PEOPLE TRY TO HIDE
-   I ALSO ENJOY PROVING OTHER PEOPLE WRONG THROUGH **FACTS** AND **LOGIC** BUT LIKE COME ON
-   Battler notices a dim outdoor light and a silhouette of someone in front of it
-   Battler 'sees' Kinzo
-   Kinzo points to the signpost of the Golden Land
    > Once again, note that Battler was the only one who saw this. Nobody observed the contrary
-   'Kinzo' is calling it his epitaph. However, this Kinzo is dead. There might be more layers to this; it is Beatrice's game after all.
-   _Kinzo_: I have no more regrets in life!! Beatrice, I am coming to join you. Along with a present, the miracle chosen by my epitaph.
    > He has to be dead... right? It was never confirmed in red though...
    > And what does he mean by 'miracle chosen by my epitaph'? Is Battler going to die? What is the 'miracle' here?
-   _Kinzo_: BEATRICE! I'VE WON THIS BET!
    > The bet... was that someone would solve the epitaph? Kinzo bet on someone solving it. What did Beatrice have to prove by betting otherwise? What are the motivations here? What does someone learn by solving this epitaph?
    > More importantly, what does Kinzo gain for winning the bet? And what does Beatrice lose?
-   Erika and Battler find the gold, and it appears to be near the jail cell in Episode 4.
-   "If I could create a world where a full 100 humans wouldn't have to work for their entire lives, ...just what kind of world would that be...?"
-   Lambda had Bern hide the more 'central parts of it' i.e. the actual solving of the riddle...
    > Rude as hell...
-   In game 3, the gold discovery could be another cat box truth, since Eva and Rosa never discussed it w/anyone.
-   In other words, the gold might not exist. It could have just been an illusion...?
-   # This mountain of gold is real. All of the ingots piled up here are real, pure gold! There are absolutely no tricks such as replicas or fakes!!
-   Battler denies Kinzo's presence as magic with the blue, saying he was probably just excited after solving the riddle
-   Riddles are like locks, and there should be some goal in mind when unlocking them.

    > Gold discovered at about 10:45

-   Eva knocks on the door to the study
-   This is strange because Natsuhi ordered the servants to lock all the doors and windows after the relatives left for the guesthouse
    > Two possibilities here:
    >
    > > 1. The servants disobeyed her
    > > 2. Eva broke into the mansion somehow
    > >    Technically there's a third option: The servants forgot to lock a particular door. But that seems unlikely considering how particular they are
-   Sometimes, multiple schemes and assumptions can fall apart due to the most direct, simple, and emotional of strategies.
-   Eva REALLY needs to talk to Kinzo. But why?
-   **Both of the keys to the study are in the study**
-   Looks like Battler and Erika solved the epitaph, and the relatives now know
-   The relatives forced themselves in after learning this. Krauss is going to pull Eva away from the study
    > This is really bad for Krauss & Natsuhi. The relatives are going to inevitably discover that Kinzo is dead now, since his presence is absolutely necessary now that the gold has been discovered
-   Natsuhi leaves the study... but does she have one of the keys?
    > The study might be completely inaccessible now.
-   waaaaaah we can't wake up kinzo no matter what
    > They are so FUCKED
-   The move of the demons that would sneer upon their efforts, had already begun
-   Battler and Erika solved the epitaph, but Erika forfeited her rights to the Golden Land.
    > Pretty interesting, Battler was previously the only one who didn't enter the Golden Land.
    > What the fuck is the Golden Land anyway? In episode 4 it was just a space for Beatrice and Maria
-   The deal was that Beatrice would stop the ceremony if the epitaph was solved.
-   Battler will not become the master of the Golden Land. So that means... there is no new Beatrice?
-   _Virgilia_: It has been several decades since we first manifested in the human world through our bond with Lord Goldsmith. ...The time since then has been very fun.
    > Pretty much confirms they're the servants right?
-   The demons are free now
-   Kinzo has been kicked down into Cocytus, the river of wailing in the underworld (Greek mythology)
-   Beatrice will continue working for Natsuhi. Something about witches not failing to show gratitude
-   Battler brought all of the adults, but none of the cousins
-   He wants to start the family conference
-   **The successor** gets another 10 billion in addition to the 2.5 billion. So that's 5/8 for the successor, and 1/8 for the other 3.
    > Who exactly is the successor though? There are two options: Natsuhi and Battler. Battler is the one who solved the epitaph with Erika, but Natsuhi's Kinzo ghost delusion insinuated that she was the proper head.
    > Battler has no interest in becoming the head though
-   Natsuhi is going back on her word and insinuating that the solver is not necessarily the head
    > Setting up for a motive, presumably...
-   Rosa suggests just asking Kinzo directly. Natsuhi what the fuck are you doing
-   Kyrie agrees.
    > Hey, attention keeps getting drawn to how ugly Battler finds all this arguing. This might be motivation for something.
    > One potential idea is that Battler becomes convinced the family is rotten to the core and goes one of two ways: The family needs to be destroyed, or he becomes enlightened like Ange.
    > He's not the detective this time, Erika is. So we don't need to doubt his potential for murder this time...
-   There's no way someone could move that much gold without being noticed, so they have no need to worry.
    > Seems like an opportunity for magic bullshit.
-   Having this mountain of gold is super distracting though
-   They're going to bribe Erika to keep quiet
    > She doesn't care
    > Poor Battler. He has to take part in this disgusting conference
-   # Some more thoughts
    > Maybe Beatrice didn't want anyone to solve the epitaph. That would be a decent explanation for the difficulty.
    > This begs the question, what is she trying to prove here? That the solver doesn't exist?
    > Ah... this might circle back to a Devil's Proof. Here's one random theory:
    > The epitaph is a bet between Kinzo and Beatrice. Two important things happened 6 and 19 years ago respectively:
    >
    > > Battler committed some sin, and Beatrice "died". I'm not certain about that second part, but I think it's true.
    > > Then the epitaph was created as Devil's Proof. Beatrice thinks the solver doesn't exist, but there's no way to completely deny their existence.
    > > Maybe Beatrice can't sleep in peace until the epitaph is properly solved? What's up with the solver gaining all her power and becoming the new Beatrice? This isn't just a succession test in Kinzo's sense, it's a succession test to become the new Golden Witch. What does being the Golden Witch even mean though?
    > > This has to tie into love somehow... Beatrice acknowledging the existence of a solver but not believing them herself... maybe it's like spurning Kinzo's love somehow...
    > > To put it more concisely, maybe there's some stupid bet like "if someone solves this you will come back to me" or whatever. That's all I can think of for now
-   # This child has nothing to gain from having someone solve the epitaph.
    > Virgilia confirms that Beatrice is losing something here.
    > This is odd. Why would Beatrice ask them to solve the epitaph in the past then?
    > This seems self-destructive. Maybe she wants to be proven wrong really badly?
-   # The gold of the Golden Land belongs to this child. She had absolutely no need to make someone find it for her or to snatch it away herself
-   Battler says the murders make sense, they could be revenge against the family or a way for her to regain power.
-   # Whether the epitaph is solved at all, this child (Beatrice) has nothing to gain at all.
-   _Virgilia_: The epitaph's riddle doesn't have any meaning for this child.
    > The RIDDLE doesn't have any meaning. But what about the existence of a solution? These are two different things.
    > In other words, the riddle itself is immaterial. Beatrice wants to be proven wrong(?)
-   The epitaph's riddle and the massacre are equally significant in Beatrice's eyes
    > I think we can reword it like this:
    >
    > > Solve the epitaph, or else I will kill the entire family.
-   Battler is justifiably confused by the overcomplicated nature of the murders
    > I mean, yeah. She's making things harder for herself by doing it this way.
-   These are 'plotline murders'
-   Three potential reasons to follow the epitaph"
    1. Misconceptions about evidence and alibis can help the culprit. She could pretend to be dead and mix herself in with the victims, then commit the murders out of order to cause confusion.
    2. Coincidence
    3. Sowing fear (**this is only one that can work**)
-   Show the fear of death I guess
    > To who? WAIT...
    > Beatrice commits the murders to show a fear of death. That must mean... solving the epitaph means one of two things:
    >
    > > "I" am no longer scared of death, and never will be, provably
    > > "I" am scared of death, you don't need to make a display to convince me
    > > "I will not be scared of death, and neither should you (Beatrice). This would line up with the final line of the epitaph...
-   The culprit would want to leave the person they hated most until the end.
    > This varied from game to game. Though, notably, it was Battler in episode 4.
-   Well, Battler is the one who consistently makes it to the last twilight. That much is pretty apparent...
-   # Battler is not the culprit. Battler did not kill anyone. This can be said of all games.
    > Right... but she's still trying to prove something to him. WHAT though? Is she trying to make him remember the sin from six years ago?
    > We have to think of it like this: The murders are committed to prove or show something to Battler. Solving the epitaph is evidence to Beatrice that this is unnecessary. How can these two ideas be reconciled?
-   # Her goal is not to make someone experience fear. And it isn't to have revenge on someone either.
    > She's trying to prove or show something, like I said.
-   _Battler_: What does she want from me that would be meaningless to her?

    > This might be the wrong way to look at it. There is meaning, but it comes from the consequences of her actions, not the actions themselves(?)

    > No, that's stupid. Well, maybe not. We'll see

    > Ah, the game itself confirmed my thinking. Cool.

    > Let's think about the end of episode 4 again. Battler forgot his sin. Beatrice explicitly stated that everyone's deaths are a result of this particular sin. In other words, she carried them out because of it, implicitly.

    > We'll go with this. The sin is the reason the murders occur at all. And yet, solving the epitaph prevents the murders from occurring.

    > Since Beatrice isn't out for revenge, I think we can assume that solving the epitaph and the murders themselves are just some means to an end. Something is proven to her either way.

    > My best theory is that Battler's sin is proven to be remembered... but that can't be it. After all, the epitaph has been proven twice now and Battler still has no idea what he even did...

    # Beato never committed murder for the sake of pleasure

# [12-4-22]

-   _Battler_: Next time you want to write a love letter, I suggest you just write 'I love you'. If you make it too roundabout and confusing, no one's gonna be able to figure it out.

    > This is all... a love letter? How?

    > I can see one reasonable way to look at this. Solving the epitaph proves that Battler(?) loves Beatrice but failing to solve it proves otherwise? Idk

-   "It was never specified that ownership of the gold would be handed over to the solver"
-   The adults decide that the conference needs to be recorded, so Rudolf pulls out a tape set.

    > Forgery is impossible with this

    > Somehow I doubt that

-   Kinzo listens to a lot of "sophisticated" music apparently
-   Kanon and Shannon come in with black tea
    _Kyrie_: Become sacrifices for us now that we crave something to talk about
-   Unknown individual knocks on the door to the conference as the clock strikes 24:00

    > Erika? That seems to be the only possibility here. The cousins are definitely out of the question.

-   Krauss and Natsuhi are discussing their options, since they essentially have none whatsoever.
-   Natsuhi thinks they should arrange for Genji to tell everyone that Kinzo went for a walk in the forest early in the morning. Arrange for his room to be 'empty'
-   Krauss doubts this plan's effectiveness because Eva and the others will label them as suspicious
    _Krauss_: There's nothing wrong with persisting until the last possible second tomorrow. If we're able to make it through safely, we won't have to lose anything. There's no need to get impatient and use that trump card
    > So Natsuhi is prepared to make Kinzo disappear now. She's willing to tank the social damage
-   Natsuhi has **both** of the keys to the study in her possession.
    _Krauss_: Let's wait for the very last moment before using our disappearance trump card. It's like a last-resort treasured sword. It's best when it remains in its sheath.
    > Ah, like the red truth.
-   Another phone call comes for Natsuhi.
    > The same "Battler" (not Battler) again?
-   This man wants revenge for what happened 19 years ago. This was precisely one year before Jessica and Battler were born.
-   Natsuhi's life didn't really begin until Jessica was born
-   Something from the last year of that hateful period is speaking vengeful words from the other end of the phone
-   Decides to transfer the call to her room. Tells Krauss she's going to bed, then locks the door
-   There's no special meaning in locking the door when you enter your own room... at least that's what she told herself.
-   Once again, the man calls her mother.
    > I find it hard to believe that Natsuhi is this person's actual mother. Like, how do you hide a pregnancy for that long? It's possible she cheated on Krauss at some point, but she can't hide something like a pregnancy.
-   The man knows about her headache. He also knows she's getting sick of the family conference.

    > So this probably has to be someone familiar with the Ushiromiya family.

    > It's also worth noting that Battler is not Asumu's child. Furthermore, we can't necessarily trust the information being given here.

    > Here's a theory: Jessica and Battler's mothers are inverted. In other words, Battler is Natsuhi's child, and Jessica is Asumu's. That would solve the troublesome red from the end of episode 4 and give a plausible idea for what the sin from 19 years ago could be.

    > But who the hell is this person?

-   _Guy_: Your name is Natsuhi. It has the kanji for a season (夏) in it. Pretty nice name
-   Natsuhi's favorite season is autumn, not summer as the kanji suggests
-   "because it's easy to pass time in. no other reason"
    > Ok
-   12:07 AM, the man asks about the clock in her room. Why does he know about it?
    > He has either been in there before, or someone told him
-   Threatens to tell Krauss and Jessica about what happened 19 years ago

    > If Natsuhi has a clear conscience, she wouldn't care about this

    > So something probably happened

-   Natsuhi lifts the clock and finds a playing card
    > What the hell is this? Something that makes her happy...?
-   _Guy_: How dare you act like a normal, neat-freak mother. You make me want to vomit, murderer. Do you want that to land on your husband and daughter as well?
-   My wounds could not be healed with any amount of money. But there is a medicine.
    > Maybe Natsuhi gave birth to someone before Jessica and he was discarded for whatever reason?
-   The only medicine is my hatred.
    > This guy is like a fail Ange
-   The guy is at the family conference. And he hates Natsuhi because of something that happened 19 years ago.
    > He sounds like Battler, but he probably isn't
-   He knows who Erika is, and he could have come here before the typhoon
-   _Guy_: I will not appear in front of anyone until you introduce me. It is useless to try and search for me. Unless you want to expose me and introduce me to everyone? Introduce me to Jessica too. **Tell her I am her older brother by one year**.
-   Guy is forcing Natsuhi to stay in the room for the rest of the night and sleep
    > Either giving her an alibi for the first twilight, or drawing suspicion to her
-   The card had the kanji for autumn, and some pattern like a tarot card

    > What could this be?

    > Could this mysterious individual have planted it there?

-   Knock at the door to the conference, nobody knows who it was. Envelope appears there
-   The envelopes are in the study. Natsuhi has both of the keys.
    > Someone would need access to it before she got the keys, which was just after the gold was discovered
-   Letter from Beatrice acknowledges that he gets the gold and is the new Head
    > Was Kinzo's ring on his corpse when he died?
    > Who had it, if it wasn't?
-   Supposedly, Krauss couldn't have left it.
    > We don't know that for sure. I mean, by doing this, he could have diverted pressure from himself and avoid his embezzlement from being discovered.
-   Fast-forward to 3:05 AM
-   Conference continued until then. No actual conclusion was reached. People just argued about bullshit
-   Gohda, Nanjo, and Erika are still awake
-   Rosa returned to the guesthouse at 1:00 AM and immediately went to bed
-   Rudolf wants to talk about something important tomorrow. It's about Battler.
    > Almost certainly about how Battler isn't Asumu's kid
-   "If I tell you about this, I'll probably be killed."
-   "It's about your birth."
    > Yep, called it.
-   Kinzo gave up on Natsuhi and started donating to many charities
-   One was the Fukuin House, where many pieces of "furniture" came from
-   Kinzo employed kids from there with exceptional grades as servants

    > Wait... I thought Kanon said he wasn't educated?

    > It's worth doubting Kinzo's supposed intentions here

-   Shannon, Kanon, Lunon, Manon, Leion.
-   Supposedly, Kinzo wanted to empower these servants and spread their wings in society
-   _Beatrice_: I see. So, an adopted child...

    > Alright, I understand now. Natsuhi didn't give birth to someone other than Jessica, just as I originally suspected. Rather, her desire to become a mother made her adopt a servant, and the man over the phone must be said servant.

    > This would explain how he knows the layout of the mansion.

    > Natsuhi must have... fired him? Discarded him somehow. Maybe because she finally became pregnant, and made it clear that he was just a placeholder until she could actually have her own child.

    > Oh nevermind.

# [12-5-22]

-   Kinzo ordered Natsuhi to raise a baby as her own, in order to succeed Krauss.
-   Natsuhi hated her body, not Kinzo.
-   Gives the baby to an older servant because she didn't like the crying.
    -   Wanted the servant to take the baby far away, and never return
    -   Servant takes the baby to the cliff Ange was at in episode 4
    -   Supposedly, a demon lured the servant there
    -   Then the servant and baby fell off the cliff
        > Worth noting that this is the second time characters have died this way
-   _Beatrice_: You are sinless. Humans are sinless. You can even say that I killed them. No, I did kill them!

    > Interesting. She's trying to take responsibility and absolve Natsuhi.

    > This is hard to explain, but maybe Beatrice is some kind of "entity" on which to blame catastrophes like these?

-   _Ronove_: If you can't accept it as an accident, blame it on us. That's why demons exist.
-   Beatrice begins to weave a story where she lured the servant and baby to the cliff

    > I am less concerned with why she's doing this, and more so questioning what is actually happening here. Whose thoughts are these, and who's trying to prove themselves innocent?

    > I imagine this wasn't just some freak accident. If it was, then why would this vengeful stranger be so... vengeful?

-   Beatrice lured them into the Golden Land and Gaap gapped them into the air, killing both

    > So Gaap is just a way of showcasing falls? I guess that makes sense. We'll need to contextualize her other appearances using this.

    > General idea is this: Beatrice lured them (not really, they were probably lured or forced to go by Natsuhi) then Gaap made them fall to their deaths. But that was just the cliff

-   _Natsuhi_: When I spotted the two of them on the rocks below, I went pale.
    > We can question why she was there in the first place, but judging by Kinzo's response, I'm not sure Natsuhi actually did anything.
-   _Kinzo_: How long will you struggle? How long will it be before you're mine? I have no interest in an empty cage. Throw it away!
    > Does the empty cage refer to the baby? I'm fairly certain he's referring to an empty vessel for Beatrice, but what does the baby have to do with that?
-   Beatrice definitely killed the baby **in the magic world**. However, you might find out that it's alive in the world of Humans. Whether it's really **alive or not**, right?
-   Erika is Bern's piece. Whose piece is the man from 19 years ago then?

    > Once again, if Natsuhi had nothing to hide, why would this man be so confident?

    > Not to put her in a Kafka trap, but I doubt this man would have such an iron grip over her if he didn't actually have some huge sin to expose.

-   Turns out Lambda was the one calling. What?
    > Her intention was to keep Natsuhi from leaving her room that night. Giving her an alibi, I guess. Or somehow drawing suspicion to her.
-   _Bern_: Both Natsuhi and Beato are like the guts of a filthy truth wrapped up in a bit of thin skin. Tearing that to bits and dragging the insides out is one of our few pleasures.
    > She's basically saying that she likes to solve mysteries. She's just a little gross about it.
-   Beatrice's piece is going to be sacrificed
-   Lambda and Bern have totally taken over the game, and they aren't going to utilize Beatrice or her furniture as actual pieces anymore. Just pins.
-   Furthermore, it was outright stated that Beatrice was just an illusion. Not that the confirmation was necessary.
    > Really have to wonder what Beatrice was trying to do here. She truly wanted to show Battler something, and I guess 4 attempts was enough to make her give up. Battler still doesn't understand what he's trying to tell her.
-   This tale was supposed to be one that Beatrice invited Battler to see. But the host has been lost, and there are no longer any guests. Neither are around in this horrible tale.
    > So I guess this is why it's called Answer Arcs. Bern is just going to rip apart all the illusions.

# October 5th, 1986; 7:00 AM

-   Probs not important, but the games were probably playing Sevens with the cards.

# FIRST TWILIGHT BEGINS

-   George is found dead in his bed
-   Neck split wide open
-   Maria, Jessica, and Rosa died similarly. Rosa was in Maria's bed.
-   No other wounds on any of the cadavers
    > Also worth noting that Natsuhi has an alibi... probably. I doubt she left her room.

# _Erika_: Detective's Authority. The detective has the right to inspect all crime scenes. Stand back, Ushiromiya Battler. This is an official privilege of this game, which the human side has accepted.

-   Kanon fell asleep in the servant room and never saw Genji between that time, and about 8 the next morning
-   A small strip of packing tape was stuck along the frame of the door to the servant waiting room, almost as though it was sealing the door shut.
-   Furthermore, there were notches made with scissors along the center of the packing tape, so that if you opened the door only a slight amount, it would be torn apart.
-   There was also a signature written across the packing tape in thin pen. It's too intricate to determine whose it is.
    > Why would someone even write their signature on the tape? Maybe someone wanted to frame another person?
    > Does the tape say something when ripped apart along the notches?
-   Genji died the same way. Belphegor notes that you need a long blade to make a cut this deep.

    > Wait wait wait wait. The stakes correspond to other people here. Let's remember the first 4 murders:
    > **STAKES PRESENT**: Mammon, Asmodeus, and Satan. The three people there were Eva, Hideyoshi, and Nanjo. I don't really know who corresponds to who, but what really matters is...

    > Belphegor was told to report to Lucifer, and then Kumasawa dashed out. The one who asked her to do so was Leviathan, and Kanon was the only other one there.

-   There was a clunking, clattering noise, as though it was taking a lot of effort to hand the receiver over.

    > It really shouldn't be that difficult, right?

    > Unless... this isn't a proper phone call.

    > The clunking and clattering could have been someone swapping out tapes in a tape deck, with a receiver just being held. In other words, this is just a recording being played back. That would also explain why Krauss didn't respond to her voice.

    > Let's go with that. If this is the case, then I see two options here:

    > > Krauss recorded those lines intentionally, without being tied up at all

    > > Krauss was actually tied up at some point and recorded

    > I mean, those things are obvious. But the first one implies he's complicit in something. Who does that, after all?

    > The motive would also be pretty clear. After all, he has every reason to try and murder everyone off to save his ass.

-   His eyes and ears are covered, so you won't be able to talk.
    > Hmm... okay.
-   Two conditions given to Natsuhi:
    1. Do not tell anyone that he has Krauss
    2. At 1:00 today, go to the foremost guest room on the 1st floor of the mansion and hide in the closet. If you can hide there for an hour without anyone finding you, you win.
-   It doesn't really matter if she's found. She needs to play along for Krauss' safety to be guaranteed.

    > Why such a specific amount of time? Some murder is going to happen and an alibi needs to be secured?

    > Wait... this is more justification for Krauss being behind everything. He's trying to give Natsuhi alibis so she can avoid suspicion!

    > It's been established that this is Lambda's piece. Erika started off the chapter by claiming that Natsuhi was the culprit. That might have been an incorrect claim, and Lambda's moves here are securing Natsuhi's innocence.

-   Rokkenjima has been cut off from the outside world, and the closed circle has been completed. **The authority of the detective piece is totally guaranteed**.
-   Everyone has been accounted for in the parlor **except** for Krauss (and Kinzo, but y'know)
-   No 19th person can exist on this island. So it's not possible for the unknown man to exist.
    > So who is he? He would need to be one of the 18. (It could still be Erika. The only stipulation was that the detective cannot be the culprit. There's no evidence that the man is the culprit)
-   Krauss's room was empty. The bed was too, but massive bloodstains similar to the other crime scenes remained.
    > This further supports that tape theory. He was likely recorded, then murdered.
-   No corpse for Krauss. We can't be sure he's dead.
    > There's also ths possibility that this blood wasn't his.
-   Krauss's door was unlocked. This is unusual.
-   Keys don't really matter. Genji's master key is missing. Locks don't matter.

-   Everyone returns to the guesthouse and discovers that **all 4 corpses have gone missing**.

    > Krauss is the only one truly unaccounted for. Furthermore, we know the culprit (in this instance) must have Genji's master key.

    > Let's commit to that theory about Krauss's blood not belonging to him. It definitely would have been possible for him to perform the murders and carry off the 4 corpses using the master key from Genji.

    > Another important note: Krauss mentioned a trump card last night... likening it to a treasured sword. Awfully similar to the hypothetical murder weapon.

    > ONE MORE THING: Krauss is one of the few people who actually knows what happened 19 years ago.

# [12-7-22]

-   _Bern_ All of us moved together.
    > Confirming that everyone was accounted for except for Krauss.
-   _Bern_ [BLUE TRUTH]: The victims aren't actually dead. They pretended to be dead, then secretly hid themselves somewhere. After all, you haven't proclaimed anyones deaths with the red truth.
    > This seems wrong, but it's fair to attempt.
-   Lambda refuses to use the red, naturally. There's no need to give Bern a reason to guess.
-   _Bern_ [BLUE TRUTH]: Krauss carried the corpses off and hid them. You've acted it out so that it looks like you've kidnapped Krauss and locked him up somewhere, but he might be free. Krauss has no alibi. Krauss hid their corpses.
    > My theory.
-   _Bern_ [BLUE TRUTH]: The corpses were different people in the first place. They were substitute corpses that closely resembled the victims. George and the others were hiding from the beginning, and later cleared up those substitute corpses. These corpses were dead from the very beginning, so they don't count towards the number of people on the island.
    > What the fuck? lmao
-   Bern uses Battler's machine gun analogy again in reference to the blue truth

-   Servant waiting room; Gaap appears
-   _Gaap_: That's a nice cut. It must've been made with a single slice. Has anyone who's capable of this manifested yet? Not good. I can't think of anyone decent who might be capable of this.
-   Genji's corpse taken away
    > No observers here. You can claim fucking anything
-   When a person's missing, they are suspected as culprit and victim
-   This ambiguity is where demons reside
-   Beatrice is trying to draw attention away from Natsuhi.

    > Further enforcing the Krauss theory

-   Relatives trying to enter Kinzo's study
-   Kinzo was last "spoken to" at about 23:00 the prior night
-   Shannon pulls out a good lie and claims Kinzo has both keys

    > CLOSED ROOM YEAAAAHHHH

    > NOOOOOOOOO WHY AM I ERIKA

-   _Erika_: It'd be pretty neat if Kinzo was lying on the bed in there with his throat cut.

    > I agree

    > Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself Kill yourself

    > I might be stupid, but why are they making such a big deal out of Erika not remembering an earlier book with an equal number of murders?

    > I'M BEING ATTACKED

    > Why does piece Battler know so much though?

-   Getting the ladder from the boiler room will probably reveal Kinzo in the incinerator as per usual right?
    > Nope
    > So Kinzo hasn't been thrown in yet
-   Rudolf is going to smash open the window with a hammer
    > Kannon and Shannon are totally helpless here. Are they going to sabotage this attempt?
-   Kinzo is told to hide under the bed or in a closet, like a proper ghost
-   Gaap is going to help him escape at the "last moment"
-   _Gaap_: I'll carefully watch over the corpses of the first twilight that I erased, making sure nothing happens to them.
-   Bernkastel will start trying to expose Kinzo's absence with a closed room argument
-   "With the door and the window, the **past and the future** to choose from, there are plenty of places to run to. Of course I won't let this be a closed room."
    > Basically implying that Kinzo can be placed in many different scenarios
-   Rudolf enters
-   The bed was empty. There were marks on it that made it seem as though someone had slipped out, but there was no one in sight.
-   The bed was cold. Rudolf feels as though Kinzo slipped out of this room a long time ago
-   Natsuhi last "met" Kinzo at 23:00 last night.
-   Relatives decide to search the room
-   The shadows that can make things 'exist' are the themselves the world of us witches, the world of demons
-   _Beatrice_: I will **not let Kinzo be killed**.

-   Erika wants to confirm that Natsuhi was indeed the last person to see Kinzo
-   Erika claims that Natsuhi is the most suspicious

    > She went to bed early last night (no confirmation, but we know this)

    > Ah... it's odd that Natsuhi was so certain that nobody else met Kinzo after 23:00

    > We know the truth, but Erika probably sees her as either the culprit or someone covering up

    > Furthermore, Natsuhi's supposed reason for being so certain contradicts the claim that Kinzo would sometimes wake up in the middle of the night

-   Eva confirms that Natsuhi 'came out of this room' at around 23:00 last night
    > Is she going to reveal the truth?
-   _Erika_: Just when did Kinzo disappear, I wonder?

    > Eva couldn't claim that Natsuhi was actually talking to Kinzo, so they don't even know if he was there at 23:00.

    > So that opens up the possibility that Kinzo has disappeared sometime over the past 1.4 years or so.

-   Kinzo's death was hidden to keep the embezzlement under wraps
-   Erika denies Kinzo's existence, and Beatrice appears to challenge her
    > Beatrice can use the blue to deny a human theory?
-   _Beatrice_ [BLUE TRUTH]: You can't deny the possibility that Natsuhi met with Kinzo at 23:00. During the six hours or more before you pushed your way into the study, Kinzo had many chances to escape from it! Because of this, you can't state decisively that Kinzo doesn't exist.

    > Very interesting inversion here. It's almost as if Erika is fighting with the red this time.

    > How exactly can this be countered? There are no facts to deny this, right?

    > Oh my god, facts. Red truth.

-   _Beatrice_: For one such as yourself, a guest who came to this island at most a day ago, there is no truth that can possibly be known!
    > We need some very powerful truth here. We need to show that Kinzo was not here from the point Natsuhi visited until the relatives crowded outside the door.
-   _Erika_: I see. So that's what kind of space this is. In that case, I'll need a piece suitable for fighting a witch. I'm the detective. My role is to take on the human culprit. You are a witch. And there does exist a fitting piece to use against witches and demons.

    > DLANOR MOMENT?

    > YEAAAAAAAHHHHHH

-   Dressed like a clergy member, perfect for confronting a witch
-   _Dlanor_: It is a pleasure to meet YOU. Dlanor A. Knox is my NAME.
-   The detailed materials about Beatrice are summarized in 600 pages
    > Ok but like, what red could even be useful here?
-   Eva can apparently prove what we need, that Kinzo **wasn't** here for that entire duration.
-   Palace guard appears and claims that entering or exiting through the door is impossible
    > I'm assuming this is the auto-lock.
-   Chiester sisters appear as well. They're obviously guns

# From last night at 23:00 until the present time, the study door was not opened even once.

> Is there something on the auto-lock that allows us to guarantee that?

> THE FUCKING RECEIPT? WHORE

> THIS WAS NEVER STATED!!!!!!!!!!!!! EXCEPT BACK IN EPISODE 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!! _SOBS AND PUKES_

> We can now confirm that Kinzo could not have been in the study when Natsuhi visited at 23:00 last night. If he was, then he would be there now. Therefore, Kinzo disappeared before 23:00 last night.

# The windows were all locked

-   Chiester squad lays down a blockade over the door and all windows

    > i.e. people are guarding them with guns?

    > is Eva Dlanor?

-   Beatrice absconds with Kinzo into a warp hole
    > Not sure what this is a metaphor for.
-   Would it be so strange if Kinzo had some alternate method of escape?
    > Ah, abusing the potential of a hidden passage existing
-   "It's only natural that we won't find them"
-   _Beatrice_ [BLUE TRUTH]: Proof is unnecessary! It's a Devil's Proof. It's impossible to find a hidden door and therefore impossible to disprove that it exists. Therefore, nobody can deny the possibility that Kinzo escaped through a hidden door.

    > I don't know how this can be denied. We need another powerful red truth. OR MAYBE...

    > THERE IT IS KNOX'S 3rd YEAAAhHHHHH

# I will not allow a hidden door to exist in this ROOM.

-   The gate is destroyed and so is the blue truth

# Knox's 3rd. It is forbidden for hidden passages to exist.

-   _Beatrice_ [BLUE TRITH]: After slipping out the door, it's possible that Kinzo noticed the receipt and returned it to its original place.

    > Invalid. The red does not allow this

    > Dlanor is going insane

    > This is a very cool demonstration of how poorly Battler was fighting before. He wasn't fighting as a "mystery" genre, he was literally just using fantasy to counter fantasy. Beatrice is fighting no differently here.

    > Also cool how Dlanor is invoking "God" to use these red truths. It's a funny little subversion, using faith to lay out axioms like this.

-   _Dlanor_: The progression of humanity, as well as techniques and knowledge that might be obtainable in the future, are decided upon by our GOD.
-   Beato might have been a fearsome witch, but blood flowed through her veins and she did breathe.
-   Beato quietly brushed aside Natsuhi's hand that tried to comfort her

    > Krauss?

    > I can think of one way Beato can get out of this.

    > Claim that Kinzo wasn't even here when Natsuhi visited at 23:00. Natsuhi talked to him over the phone.

-   _Beatrice_ [BLUE TRUTH]: Natsuhi claims to have 'talked with Kinzo in the study', but she never said she spoke with him face to face. She could have called him while he was somewhere else.
    > Exactly what I expected.
-   He could have been at Kuwadorian
-   Natsuhi might have been referring to the room as 'Kinzo'
    > Wow this is foul. Is there any red to deny these?
-   Kinzo could have climbed out of the window and Natsuhi closed it

    > Is there any red that can completely destroy all of these blue truths?

    > Well, if we had conclusive proof of Kinzo's death, we'd be done here.

-   Erika plays detective and confirms that the Kinzo which Natsuhi refers to, is indeed, Kinzo.
    > Interesting. Another key difference in this game is the fact that Erika is fighting on both Beatrice's plane and her own.
-   No red here, but Natsuhi repeats Erika's claim: 'I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi did, at 23:00 last night, speak with Ushiromiya Kinzo while in the same room as him, this room'
-   Additionally, she did not chase him out the window.

# When Natsuhi refers to 'Kinzo', she means Ushiromiya Kinzo and nothing else.

# Natsuhi claims to have met face to face with Kinzo in the study at 23:00

-   Because Natsuhi 'the one who knew the truth', had denied them, those denials had gained the power of the red truth!
-   The only remaining blue truth is that Kinzo is still somewhere in this room.
    > This... is technically a Devil's proof. We need red that says something like "Kinzo is not in this room"

# Kinzo is not under the bed.

# Kinzo is not in the bathtub.

# Kinzo is not in the closet

> excluding his relationship with genji

# DIE THE DEATH

# SENTENCE TO DEATH

# GREAT EQUALIZER IS THE DEATH

# [12-9-22]

-   Erika can now safely conclude that Kinzo was not in this room when Natsuhi entered. She lied about meeting Kinzo last night.

-   ...or not. Battler is going to deny Erika's truth somehow? More fucked up logic that technically works?

    > More importantly... why exactly is Battler trying to deny this? Does he feel pity for Natsuhi?

    > No, I think it's more like he disagrees with how shameless and cruel everyone is.

    > Anyway, how can he disappear from the room with all of that preestablished red? Some bullshit about inheriting Kinzo's name? "Kinzo is no longer Kinzo after removing the ring"

    > But that still doesn't resolve anything...

-   To begin, Kinzo is lying in bed listening to the report. He doesn't give a shit, and eventually falls asleep.
-   Before leaving, Natsuhi inspects the room very thoroughly.
    > Okay... what does this prove? Did Natsuhi not actually do her inspection, maybe?
-   Most of the room would be in Natsuhi's blindspot as she did her inspection.
    > Ah, he could have left the study while Natsuhi wasn't looking?

# You cannot leave through the door without Natsuhi thinking something was odd

# Natsuhi did not hear the sound of the door opening while in the room

# Kinzo entering or exiting through the door will not be permitted

> What options are left here? The window? That's not possible either.

> Battler is trying to prove that a face-to-face conversation actually occurred in this room... I don't see how this is possible. So far, we only know that Kinzo can move about the room freely. He cannot leave through the door, and he cannot hide in the room.

> I see one option. He could have slipped out with Natsuhi? But there's no way.

> The window? Seriously?

# This window is sealed from the inside, and Natsuhi did not help Kinzo escape

> Kinzo could have jumped out without Natsuhi noticing? What?

**WHAT BETTER WAY TO ENJOY A DRINK ON A TWISTED NIGHT...THAN LEAPING THROUGH THE RAINSWEPT SKIES!!!**

> ok that was cool

# The window was locked from the inside

> Natsuhi locked it, I guess. This is so fucked LOL

> Remembering Shannon's red barrier when Beatrice was assaulting her back in episode 2...

-   _Dlanor_: You who have thrown away your life and jumped are a MARTYR! Well done, you have smashed our closed room BARRIER.

# Knox's 8th. It is forbidden for the case to be resolved with clues that are not PRESENTED!

-   _Dlanor_ [BLUE TRUTH]: Was it shown beforehand that a blind spot existed within the study for Natsuhi? If not, this theory will not be permitted.

# When we entered the study, its structure was clearly described.

-   There's no way a human could catch a witch. For one such as her, without love, even touching Beato was impossible.
    > Interesting... she really is like an inverted Ange.
-   _Battler_: It's still just the first twilight! I'll teach these newcomers that your game isn't that easy!
-   _Battler_: Erika. I'm not giving the riddle of the golden witch to you. I'll solve it. That riddle belongs to the two of us. Right, Beato?

    > Assuming the "riddle" is figuring out who Beatrice is and what she wants to show Battler?

    > Ok but like how is Battler totally fine. Did he actually jump? There were observers...

-   Everyone agrees that Kinzo could have done this

    > Alright, I think I see what's going on here. Everyone understands what Battler was trying to do (preserve Beatrice? Prevent everyone from ruthlessly accosting Natsuhi?) and they're all collectively believing this FARCE

    > Beatrice disappears, and Shannon says something(?)

    > Probably just a coincidence

-   _Battler_: Beato's game isn't forgiving. It's doubtful whether the classic patterns of the mystery genre even work here. Your swordsmanship isn't bad, but you ought to be a bit more flexible in your thinking.
-   Erika is going to chew this riddle to bits
    > Okay so I think I see how this game needs to be played now. Battler has to basically preserve Beatrice in order to figure out what she was trying to tell him? It's still not 100% clear to me, but I guess he's fighting to preserve some kind of solidarity between the family members
-   Dlanor and Virgilia were friends in heaven?
-   _Dlanor_: She is the original master of this WORLD. And you are the proper guest, invited by that MASTER. That is why I have come to pay my RESPECTS.
    > Huh. She addressed Virgilia with Mrs.
-   Virgilia puts on a magic spectacle of making tea, and Dlanor claims that a tea set existed and was used to make the tea normally. Instead of outright crushing the magic, she acknowledged the potential of interpreting it as magic.
    > Exactly what Ange did.

# Knox's 9th. It is permitted for observers to let their own conclusions and interpretations be heard.

> Her interpretation does not deny the existence of magic for others. In other words, no red was used. She just stated her own interpretation.

-   _Dlanor_: Magic that hides the result in darkness is EVIL. However, magic that enshrouds the process is not necessarily EVIL. My foe is evil itself, not MAGIC.
    > Very very good line...
-   _Battler_: The important thing is that you're being served some tea, so it's common courtesy to avoid complaining about how it was made.
    > Dlanor is a kid who can't have nonsweet things?

# _Battler_: So then... is magic... a gentle... lie?

> Ohhhhhh another really good line...

> Virgilia says it's more like embellishment

-   _Dlanor_: When giving a child candy, you can take a crumpled up one out of your pocket, or you can use some clever sleight of hand to take the candy OUT. The impression given by each method varies GREATLY.
    > The result of giving them candy has been made more beautiful and fun...
-   _Dlanor_: Hunting witches is my JOB. However, I personally find witches PITIABLE. ..In the end, that doesn't change the fact that I sentence witches to death. In the end, my pity is nothing more than a useless embellishment. It makes no difference. So it would be better to not have it.
    > Pity is magic?
-   Battler and Virgilia disagree. Even if two results look the same, whether or not there's warmth behind the feelings of whoever gave it to you makes a big difference.

    > 'In its deliberate attempt to be real, it becomes more real than the real itself.'

    > I can't help but think of Discworld here. I'm not one to draw comparisons (anymore), but everything being said here reminds me of Death's famous line: 'Humans need fantasy to **be** human. To be the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape.'

# [You need to believe in things that aren't true. How else can they become?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlKnkHdJdIg)

> It All Makes Sense Now

> I think this entire conflict starts to make more sense when we think of Beatrice as a concept akin to say, justice, duty, pity, whatever. These things aren't real. Why do we let them exist then?

> Because they make life better. At least, that's my answer. They make things interesting. Now...

> **How did Kinzo ever obtain that gold?**

-   Dlanor came here to apologize.
    > For what though?
-   The fight wasn't luck of the draw.

# Kinzo is dead at the starting time for all games

-   Dlanor didn't use this red.

# Knox's 2nd. It is forbidden for supernatural agencies to be employed as a detective technique.

> Interesting. Facts that haven't been proven directly cannot be used, basically. Intuiton is bullshit, witches are bullshit.

# The window was never opened after it started raining

> I'm not really sure how this was proved. But sure.

-   It's almost as though Bern and Lambda are conspiring to prevent Kinzo's existence from being denied.
-   So they let Kinzo escape. But why?
-   Dlanor thinks they have some sort of wicked goal.
-   _Dlanor_: Furudo Erika is a very evil entity. She's lost face with her recent defeat and is burning with a desire for revenge. Even I don't know what she is planning. However, it can't be anything good.
-   Nobody can reach the Golden Land if Beato doesn't want them to.

    > So she wanted Ange to come?

    > I guess that's because Ange finally understood the nature of magic.

-   _Erika_: As if you had a heart that could get injured. You lowly witch-hunting murder doll.

    > I kinda hate this bitch

    > This isn't important, but I'm probably more Dlanor-coded now that I've actually read this much. We'll see.

# First Twilight Investigation

> That's right, Kinzo's disappearance isn't the real game here. Just a bonus mystery.

-   Start by destroying the witch theory with respect to the letter at 24:00.

# Before the family conference, Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa left the mansion and moved to the guesthouse.

# Of those who remain, only Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji were in the second floor corridor, while all others were in the dining hall.

-   The mansion was completely locked, which means "nobody" could have knocked and placed the letter.

    > Supposedly. I see one good possibility here: The latter 3 are conspiring.

    > Additionally, someone could have pretended to go to the guesthouse and stayed inside the mansion.

-   Erika confirms both of these possibilities immediately
-   She also throws out some dumb bullshit to simulate a potential "knock".
    > I don't really like any of her suggestions, but they are technically valid. Blegh.

# [12-10-22]

# Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji did not even touch that letter!

> Interesting...

-   Bern says it would be easy if Kanon, the last person to enter, dropped the letter

# Among all those inside the mansion at 24:00, not a single person placed that letter in the corridor.

> This does introduce the possibility that someone who was in the mansion before 24:00, but not at 24:00, placed the letter. Of course, that means that the one who placed it and the one who knocked are different.

-   Someone who existed outside the mansion at 24:00 placed the letter somewhere other than the hallway. Then, it was moved by some means and ended up 'placed in the hallway'.
-   Glued to the bottom of the serving cart maybe
    > Let's review. The letter appeared at roughly ~24:00, and nobody in the mansion put it there. So it needed to appear there by some mechanism other than them. It's also possible that someone in the dining hall put the letter somewhere else long before 24:00

# Neither Krauss, Natsuhi, nor Genji knocked

# This refers to 'knocking' in every sense of the word. No pillars, casettes, nothing. None of them knocked.

-   Someone other than those three made the knock, or else a sound that could be misidentified as a knock.

# At 24:00, excepting Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji in the second floor corridor and all of the people in the dining hall, no Humans existed inside the mansion

# In addition to Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji, none of those in the dining hall knocked on that door. This includes all forms of 'knocking' as before.

# It was impossible for any character within the mansion to be the source of a knocking sound. This refers to even unobserved people that no one has noticed.

> So it had to be someone outside.

-   Someone outside the guest house could have recorded a knock and played it at exactly 24:00. But this wouldn't have worked if the letter had fallen elsewhere.
    > Right. The knock clearly communicated the letter's arrival.

# No one in the mansion placed the letter in the hallway. This includes doing so by all concepts, such as directly, indirectly, intentionally, coincidentally, and unintentionally.

> This is hard to beat. However, we can maybe recycle Erika's theory and suppose that the letter was dropped out of some compartment at 24:00 along with the knocking sound.

> Could someone in the dining hall 'not exist' in the mansion at 24:00?

# At 24:00, only Erika, George, Jessica, Maria, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa existed outside the mansion.

> That narrows things down.

# The letter never existed on the ceiling of the hallway.

# The letter never touched the serving cart.

# It was impossible for anyone outside the mansion to influence anything inside the mansion after the family conference began.

> The casette tape truth regarding the knock is still valid. That works. The problem is the letter.

# None of the characters misidentified a knocking sound. In other words, it was a real knock. Not one on a casette, or a pillar, or whatever.

# Something definitely hit the door. It's totally impossible that any sounds except hitting that door directly would be misinterpreted as a knock.

> Fuck

-   Maybe an automatic door knocker? This still doesn't explain the letter, though I think you could argue that the letter was attached to the automatic door knocker.

# To knock means someone hitting a door with their hand

> Fuck 2.0

# Knock refers to the action of standing directly in front of a door and hitting it with a hand.

-   "Useless pieces are painful even to remember"

    > :eueeeeghghh:

    > Let's think carefully here. The red on line 961 is probably the most important. Nobody in the mansion, not even unobserved individuals, was the source of the knock.

    > This immediately narrows things down to the ones outside the mansion. We then run into the red on line 982. Nobody outside the mansion influenced things inside the mansion after the conference began. Note that this doesn't say "nobody outside the mansion knocked". That would be a lot worse.

    > But how can someone outside the mansion knock on the door?

    > Okay, here's a theory.

    > Someone who moved to the guesthouse placed the letter in the hallway before the conference started, but out of sight. Maybe under a carpet or something. The letter was then moved later by someone inside the mansion, which shouldn't count as placing it.

    > Now here's the important part. The clock in the main hall was forwarded by a few minutes. This means that when it rang out, **it was not actually 24:00**. This lets us bypass the red. Someone from the guesthouse could have have knocked at that time, then exited the mansion to keep the red intact. This doesn't count as influencing the conference, because as Dlanor herself said, the knock on its own did not provide any important information. It was simply a way of indicating the letter's arrival.

    > I think this works.

-   New theory from Detective Erika
-   Battler wriggled down the rain gutter into the courtyard.

    > Ok. So? Kinzo could still escape dumbass

    > this is the character ever

    > HOW IS SHE THIS PATHETIC

-   Erika goes feral for a second, then lighting strikes, and she's normal again. Everyone is just like "alright"

    > Yeah

-   Erika checks everyone's alibis
-   Battler returned to the guesthouse at **3:00 AM**. Then, the rest of them split up 30 minutes later

    > Earlier notes said Battler returned at **3:05 AM**. This might be evidence to support the tampered clock idea.

-   The corpses will be "impossible to find for a Human"

# Anyone looking at George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, or Genji's corpses could confirm at a glance that they are dead.

-   Beatrice's goal is different now. She just wants to protect Natsuhi.
-   Hiding the corpses throws doubt onto whether there were corpses in the first place, just barely allowing Natsuhi to avoid being a suspect.
    > Huh?
-   Natsuhi can claim that the suspects of the first twilight were shrimply playing dead.
    > I mean... I guess. This seems like a terrible strategy...
-   In the human world, perpetual check is a valid move.
-   Remember that Natsuhi was ordered to go into a closet at 1:00, which is in just a few minutes.

-   Erika is accusing Natsuhi because her alibi isn't valid. There is no proof she was in her room the whole night.
-   Natsuhi is uncooperative and doesn't provide an alibi

    > Krauss could give her one, but he's not here

    > I think we can reasonably suspect a murder will happen while Natsuhi is in the closet.
    >
    > > (Insert joke about Eva and Natsuhi exploring each others bodies)

-   She was given permission to bear the One-Winged Eagle in her heart
    > Well, by a ghost.
-   The door to the guest room was **unlocked**
    > Interesting. My immediate thought is that whoever murdered Genji took his master key and unlocked it afterwards.
-   The room was empty.
-   A carpet was laid down in the closet.
    > Was this always there?
-   Natsuhi locked and chained the door
    > I guess this is all a ploy to draw more suspicion to Natsuhi, not to give her alibis.
-   Natsuhi unlocks the door and the chain to avoid suspicion, then enters the closet
-   Someone needed a key to place the card in Natsuhi's room
-   It's realistic to assume that one of the servants lent the culprit a hand
-   How did they know that autumn is my favorite season?
    > Because it's Krauss...
-   ...If I asked even my husband what my favorite season is, he would probably be stumped for an answer.
    > Oh
-   Just once, I told it to a single person. That's right **Shannon**.
    > OH
-   The culprit, or one of their accomplices, has to be Shannon!
    > Well, I do know Shannon was (most likely) the culprit in episode 1 (and subsequently 2-4 because of dumb extra knowledge)
-   Shannon has served the family for 10 years
-   Kinzo says that anger is the fastest sedative to cure fear and uncertainty
-   The most fearful people always get angry the quickest
    > Probably true

# I never told anyone except Shannon that I like autumn.

-   If I wasn't given this time in the closest, I wouldn't have realized this
-   Hideyoshi enters the room.
    > He did not know it was unlocked. In fact, he thought it was locked.
-   He then closes and locks the door behind him, and then **seemingly** the sound of him setting the chain.
-   _Hideyoshi_: Just in case. In this weather, it's pretty much night out there anyway.
    > Closing the shutters?
-   It seems safe to assume that everyone was taking a break, and it was probably unsafe to return to the guesthouse.
    > This could be some kind of plan. Whoever gave Hideyoshi the key to this room might be the culprit (or an accomplice)
-   Eventually, Natsuhi hears a strange, sobbing voice from Hideyoshi
-   Natsuhi thinks to herself and deems herself the final head of the family
-   _Hideyoshi_: Who are you? How did you get in here? Wh-What's that? W-Wait a sec!
-   Eva arrives and tries to open the door
-   Natsuhi hears nothing at all
    > First idea: this was a suicide
    > Second idea: Hideyoshi faked his own death

# [12-11-22]

-   He was lying face down on the bed, so this wasn't a suicide. His death is certain(?)
    > No observer. But I think it's fair to say he's truly dead...
-   Stake in the back
-   Hideyoshi left the parlor about 10 minutes ago to rest
-   Eva told him to wait for her
-   Looks like another closed room murder

    > It's pretty obvious that this was a set-up to frame Natsuhi.

    > She's going to be found in the closet

    > Can we be certain that nobody else is in the room?

    > Of course, the only one unaccounted for is Krauss.

-   The chain was truly set by Hideyoshi.
-   Hideyoshi's corpse is carried out to prevent it from being "gapped" away
    > This is a very simple idea, but did anyone check under the bed?
-   Erika is just barely prevented from opening the closet
-   Natsuhi leaves the room without being discovered
-   Nvm

-   Erika assembles everyone in the parlor and locks the door
-   Bern proclaims checkmate

    > If Erika guesses Natsuhi, that's incorrect

    > Does Bern actually have a solution for the letter and knock?

    > I'm going to assume Bern is actually incorrect, and Battler will step in as the proper detective.

    > What will happen to Erika?

-   _Virgilia_: (to Beato) By the 4th game, you had sent him all your messages. In other words, Battler could realize the truth at any moment. But he's still soft in some ways. So even if the games continue like this a hundred times, he won't solve it for all eternity. He'll just search for the blue bird forever. And that's you, Beatrice.
    > Virgilia is implying that the truth is incredibly harsh? It's something that Battler can't fathom because of his "soft" disposition.
-   Even if this game continues hundreds more times, you will never reach the answer you seek, for all eternity.

    > WHAT DOES SHE WANT

    > WHY ARE GIRLS LIKE THIS

-   Bern and Lambda's abuse of the game is something they both need. End Battler's softness and Beatrice's hesitation.
-   That's why she called them here. To end the eternal torture between you two.
-   _Virgilia_: Beatrice... how long do you intend to stay there, neither alive, nor dead?
    > She's the cat in the box.
-   "You must choose whether to take his hand and rise up to heaven or grab him and fall into hell."
-   Purgatory can be a lot worse than hell, because those in purgatory still have some hope left.
-   The key to the box that you were afraid to open... has been brought to you by those two (Bern and Lambda).
-   Beatrice, it's time for you to die now. I hope your heart is stopped by the hand of the person you desire.
-   Fast-forward ALL THE WAY to midnight

    > Presumably because Bern is going to end the game...?

-   _Bern_: No matter how many pieces we see outside of the 18, they are phantoms.
-   _Erika_: Though it may be only for a short while, I will most certainly make my master forget about the poison that torments her.
    > Boredom?
-   The Court Of Illusions will now begin...

-   Kinzo slipped out of the study and is hiding somewhere on Rokkenjima
    > False, but that blue truth wasn't denied
-   Krauss was captured and is being confined somewhere
    > Probably false...
-   Eva is alive
-   Rudolf is alive
-   Rosa was killed on the first twilight
-   Jessica, George, and Maria all died on the first twilight
-   Natsuhi is alive
-   Hideyoshi was killed shortly before
-   Kyrie is alive
-   Nanjo is alive
-   Genji died on the first twilight
-   Shannon and Kanon are alive
-   Gohda and Kumasawa are alive

# **Erika claims Natsuhi is the culprit**

> ![oh my gah](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kg0yKLE3QkM/hqdefault.jpg)

# Note to the reader: I'm going to start including imeowges from this point furward. I hope this makes the viewing experience more engaging.

-   Erika is naturally challenged by Beatrice
-   Natsuhi feigns calmness

    ![bullied kid](assets\Umineko5to8_Kpa9ilC7zF.jpg)

-   Bern claims Natsuhi is the culprit

> Wow, even Bern is claiming Natsuhi as the culprit. That can't be true right? I mean, technically, Natsuhi wasn't **observed** in her room for the entire night, nor was she observed in the closet during the entire duration of Hideyoshi's murder... but still.

-   Naturally, Beatrice claims the culprit isn't human. Lambda says something cool:

    ![let's go lambda](assets\Umineko5to8_l0kPqv0bt8.jpg)

-   If the witch wins, the truth about the game will disappear into darkness. If Erika wins, the illusion of the witch will be wiped from the board.
-   Erika supposedly has nothing to lose

    > I doubt that. I'm pretty sure Bern will just kill her

    ![erika is fighting for her life](assets\Umineko5to8_nK0vLwC6LR.png)

    > Case in point

-   Erika first claims that because everyone was accounted for in the parlor except Natsuhi, she must have murdered Hideyoshi.

    > Okay but what about Krauss...

    ![bern i think u are missing something](assets\Umineko5to8_QjE6Dedj6s.jpg)

-   Inside this cat box that will never be opened, false charges that everyone accepts are worth no more or less than the truth.

-   Beatrice tries to prevent things from moving non-chronologically. Bern says that doesn't matter

    ![objection](assets\Umineko5to8_Kz449I8374.jpg)

-   Lambda sides with Beatrice and forces Erika to start with the first twilight
-   Erika starts by claiming that Natsuhi has no alibi from 24:00 on the 4th to the morning of the next day

    ![natsuhi has no alibi, she is the culprit](assets\Umineko5to8_vHWRHVVEdL.png)

    > Good lird

    ![we have to prove that everybody else has one](assets\Umineko5to8_0x9TEjgfx0.jpg)

-   Gohda and Kumasawa claim their alibis: Gohda was alone in the guesthouse servant room while Kumasawa went to bed in the waiting room
    > Gohda is lying, isn't he? He was talking to Nanjo in the parlor
-   Erika and Bern claim that they can prove both of their alibis
-   time for red v blue

    ![beato's first blue](assets\Umineko5to8_sFKh8UVjxx.jpg)

-   Neither Bern nor Dlanor are going to step in with the red
-   Erika talked to Eva after dinner last night, and she was told something interesting.

    > This is related to the epitaph, presumably?

    > Nope, the receipt

    > No way. She put a receipt in the door to the waiting room?

-   Kumasawa's alibi has been established

# After Kumasawa returned to the guesthouse, she never went to the second floor until morning.

> I'm assuming Gohda is going to be outed as a liar, but his alibi will be established thanks to Nanjo.

-   Sort of. He did actually return to the receipted servant room, then was in the lounge with Erika and Nanjo until 3. There's his alibi.

# After Gohda returned to the guesthouse, he never went up the second floor until morning.

-   Erika lays out the guesthouse situation at 24:00
-   The gold was found, and a meeting was called with Battler and the relatives. Erika, the 3 cousins, Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa stayed in the guesthouse.

# At 24:00 in the guesthouse, George, Jessica, and Maria were alive and in the second floor cousin room. Nanjo, Gohda, and Kumasawa were on the first floor.

# No murder before 24:00 took place.

# At 24:00, Natsuhi, Krauss, and Genji were in a corridor on the 2nd floor of the mansion. All the remaining people were at the family conference in the dining hall. Of course, no murder had occurred yet. Genji was also alive.

-   Beato is a piece this time, so she doesn't actually know the truth. She's basically in Battler's position
-   Nanjo is clear from 1:00 to 3:00.
-   What about from 12:00 to 1:00?

# From 1:00 to 3:00, Erika, Nanjo, and Gohda spent their time in the lounge on the first floor of the guesthouse.

# Nanjo was with Erika from 24:00 to 3:00.

-   Furthermore, Nanjo's door was sealed from the moment he went to bed till Battler's scream the next morning
-   Erika can prove that Battler returned to the room, immediately went to bed, and that nothing else happened in that room until he woke up

    > The crime occurred between 24:00 and 3:00 then?

    > I'm not sure how to prove that. Unless, of course, Erika put a seal in the door after Battler went to bed.

    > Assuming this, she can listen to everything that happens in the room since hers is adjacent

-   Erika shrimply put her ear against the wall the entire night.
    > love this freak

# Ushiromiya Battler returned to the cousin room at 3:00 AM and fell asleep. After that, until the discovery of the crime, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in that room!

> Anyone who wasn't in the guesthouse before 3:00 AM now has a free alibi.

-   Everyone in the guesthouse had an alibi.

    > So it needs to be someone from the mansion.

    > In other words, someone who was in the mansion at 24:00, left the mansion at some point between 24:00 and 3:00, then committed the crime.

-   Tricky part is that Erika was in the lounge until 3:00. How can someone reach the second floor without her noticing?

# It is impossible to reach the second floor of the guesthouse without anyone in the lounge noticing it. Though of course, this only refers to reaching the second floor from inside the building.

-   Erika fucking sealed all the windows from the outside. In the rain. On both floors.

    ![you are an actual fucking freak. i love you so much](assets\Umineko5to8_yT8WcfRmwk.jpg)

# It was impossible to read the second floor of the guesthouse without passing through the lounge, and impossible to reach it at all without Erika, who was in the lounge, knowing about it!

> So the crime must have happened between 24:00 and 1:00...

# Of all the people in the dining hall, not one of them left the dining hall until 1:00 AM.

> Free alibis for them

-   So the only three left are Krauss, Natsuhi, and Genji.

# When Genji finished transferring the call, he immediately returned to the waiting room.

> I feel like Bern is kind of cheating with the red here. I will ignore this because I like looking at her face

![bern going :D](assets\Umineko5to8_t2rTu8nQtq.jpg)

-   Eva sealed Genji's door at 1:00 AM as well
    > The tape.com

# At 1:00 AM, Eva sealed Genji's waiting room, and that seal with broken by Kanon and Kumasawa in the morning when the crime was discovered.

> So Genji was also murdered between 24:00 and 1:00

# During the short break at 1:00 AM, the first two to leave the dining hall were Rosa and Eva. Until Eva returned, everyone in the dining hall remained there. After seeing Rosa off, Eva went to the waiting room and sealed it. She did not enter the room at all during this time.

# Genji never left the mansion after 24:00

> We're down to two suspects. Krauss and Natsuhi.

-   Bern asks Natsuhi to confess to Krauss being the culprit
-   The witches are distorting the truth to fit Erika's narrative

    ![virgilia saying stuff about lambda being the game master](assets\Umineko5to8_GBKnUKVACj.jpg)

-   The witches have actually been conspiring with Erika. That being said, her truth has been acknowledged as a red truth.

-   Battler says the real truth isn't something that's determined when everyone accepts it. It's something you find after thoroughly investigating both possibilities

    ![battler pointing out how weak beato's strat currently is](assets\Umineko5to8_scqcmFcSzo.jpg)

-   Beatrice has to find a different truth and show Lambda, the commander of this game

    > I'm not sure how that's possible. How do you get through the currently established red?

-   Show that her truth is **more correct** than Erika's.
    > Show that Krauss is the culprit? That's like... the only possibility
-   As long as I don't believe Natsuhi is the culprit, it won't be the truth.

    > Battler is straight up willing to let the witch exist

    > What

-   Battler is just straight up denying the red???
-   You should never assume something is the truth until you actually check it.

    ![kind of a ridiculous example but i see the point](assets\Umineko5to8_q2n4moLXZA.png)

    > Battler what the fuck do you mean there's a lack of proof

    > EVERYONE HAS ALIBIS EXCEPT FOR HER AND NATSUHI

    > unless the red can't be trusted. wait

    ![this is a cool line](assets\Umineko5to8_Ozf9oS25V8.jpg)

-   Virgilia is going to give Battler a single red:

# Ushiromiya Natsuhi is not the culprit!

-   Bern and Lambda are trying to force Beatrice into saying Krauss is the culprit

-   Natsuhi refuses to accuse Krauss
-   Bern goes villain mode

    ![Bern u are so cruel.......](assets\Umineko5to8_iN8rMiruqo.jpg)

    > What about the red?

    > What then? Do we just take Krauss as the culprit?

-   What happens to Natsuhi if they move on to the next game with her as the culprit?
-   _Beatrice_: I know the strength of a man who believed even though everyone said he was wrong, and I know the suffering he went through when he was forced to abandon that belief! Truth can only be found in the gap between those who doubt and those who believe!

    > Beato refuses to give up

    ![RAW](assets\Umineko5to8_WVZvTBvU5W.png)

# Ushiromiya Krauss is not the culprit. And he was killed long ago, shortly after you heard his voice over the phone, get it?

> HUH???

> WHAT. HOW? THERE ARE NO OTHER OPTIONS

-   Natsuhi is the last person who can protect the honor of the Ushiromiya family.
-   ...But there's nothing left that can be done.
-   Lambda begins reading out the verdict:
-   During the hour before 1:00 AM, Krauss, George, Jessica, Maria, Rosa, and Genji were killed one after another!
-   Beatrice has to prove an alibi for Natsuhi to prevent her eminent denial

    ![I REFUSE TO DENY NATSUHI'S INNOCENCE](assets\Umineko5to8_3d05Sn6Lca.jpg)

-   _Natsuhi_: You cannot disprove the existence of my honor with evidence and alibis. You can't. The Ushiromiya family crest engraved into my heart is immortal!!!

    > This is so fucking crazy. The red doesn't even line up

-   Erika constructed a more believable truth, and so it would swallow up every other truth.
-   **EVEN IF IT HAPPENED TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL TRUTH**

    ![jesus fucking christ](assets\Umineko5to8_9DidHqQkdV.jpg)

-   Bern denies Natsuhi's own reality

    > good FUCKING god

    ![JESUS FUCKING CHRIST](assets\Umineko5to8_D2eEhsIOvb.jpg)

    > OH MY FUCKING GOD

-   The true Kinzo never once trusted Natsuhi during his entire life.

# Pitiful woman. You will now face the truth... that you never gained Ushiromiya Kinzo's trust as long as he lived.

# ..................................

-   Right now, no humans exist on this island except for those in this parlor.
-   And... with one exception, it has been shown that none of them have committed murder.

![You're the culprit, Natsuhi-san.](assets\Umineko5to8_tiBIH7rXhQ.jpg)

> I can't take notes during this, sorry.

-   Beatrice is thrown to the goats, and her screams are those of a human, not a witch

> # DLANOR????

> USE THE RED!!! USE THE RED!!! USE THE RED VIRGILIA GAVE BATTLER!!!!!!!!!!!

-   _Dlanor_: There is nothing that is not healed with TIME. And there is no truth that cannot be reached if you spend enough time SEARCHING. However, all trials have a limited time in which the truth must be DECIDED. Therefore, a truth that cannot be reached within that limited time cannot become TRUTH.

-   Is it even possible to put together a truth where she's not the culprit?
-   What about that single piece of red?

# Real truth doesn't exist anywhere...

![it doesn't, huh](assets\Umineko5to8_bZ0u3cIp4U.jpg)

-   Battler starts by doubting Erika's seals

    > It's tape though isn't it...

    > Yeah...

# Both Erika and Eva's seals were perfect

-   _Beatrice_: Liar. I'll never trust your promises again.
-   _Battler_: Huh? When did I ever make a promise to you, and what was the lie?

    > The sin...

    ![Hell might not be so bad](assets\Umineko5to8_tXOv44V6BT.png)

-   Battler begins throwing out absurd blue truths, none of which make a single dent in the red
