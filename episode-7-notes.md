> Let's copy over the questions we had from the tea party:

# QUESTIONS

1. What are the circumstances surrounding Battler's birth? Specifically, who is his real mother, and is he the baby from 19 years ago? Is he somehow related to that baby?
2. Was Beatrice born out of Shannon's love for Battler?
3. It's been established that something will be proven to Beatrice in one of two ways: the epitaph being solved, or everyone being murdered. What exactly is being proven?
4. Furthermore, Featherine said that anyone who knows the truth becomes an endless witch themself. Solving the epitaph also causes one to become an endless witch, which means it somehow means you've learned the truth. How is the epitaph related to the truth?
5. Why did Kanon and Shannon split from their original "true" self or whatever?
6. What **is** the Golden Land exactly?
7. What happened to the mansion and the guesthouse?
8. What was Battler's sin?
9. (Most likely linked to #3) What's the motive behind the murders?

> Now we can begin.

-   _Virgilia_: A dream is something drawn in the sand between the coming and receding waves.
-   No wave will ever come again to wipe away the dream she drew.

    > Is the background here... the chapel?

    > It is. Wonder what that implies

-   Suddenly in a room with several Inquisitors of Heresy... but from a different department. Also there are suspects present.

    > She's talking to... Shannon?

-   The maid she's pointing at has no alibi-- and her proposed one contradicted the facts
    > Ah... was Kinzo murdered? It mentions a study...
-   Know that your position as the culprit is an unshakable fact.
-   Motives are unnecessary in mysteries.
    > BUT THAT'S LIKE. ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS (#9)

---

-   Battler and Virgilia are in front of (Beatrice's) coffin
-   Written in the book was a dream that would be more enjoyable for her than any other
-   The tale will be shut up with you in your coffin, for all eternity. So no one will be able to read it except for you.

    > A truth that only needs to pass between them.
