> Let's copy over the questions we had from the tea party:

# QUESTIONS

1. What are the circumstances surrounding Battler's birth? Specifically, who is his real mother, and is he the baby from 19 years ago? Is he somehow related to that baby?
2. Was Beatrice born out of Shannon's love for Battler?
3. It's been established that something will be proven to Beatrice in one of two ways: the epitaph being solved, or everyone being murdered. What exactly is being proven?
4. Furthermore, Featherine said that anyone who knows the truth becomes an endless witch themself. Solving the epitaph also causes one to become an endless witch, which means it somehow means you've learned the truth. How is the epitaph related to the truth?
5. Why did Kanon and Shannon split from their original "true" self or whatever?
6. What **is** the Golden Land exactly?
7. What happened to the mansion and the guesthouse?
8. What was Battler's sin?
9. (Most likely linked to #3) What's the motive behind the murders?

---

> Now we can begin.

-   _Virgilia_: A dream is something drawn in the sand between the coming and receding waves.
-   No wave will ever come again to wipe away the dream she drew.

    > Is the background here... the chapel?

    > It is. Wonder what that implies

-   Suddenly in a room with several Inquisitors of Heresy... but from a different department. Also there are suspects present.

    > She's talking to... Shannon? No, she's probably talking to whoever Kanon and Shannon "came from". The original person

-   The maid she's pointing at has no alibi-- and her proposed one contradicted the facts
    > Ah... was Kinzo murdered? It mentions a study...
-   Know that your position as the culprit is an unshakable fact.
-   Motives are unnecessary in mysteries.
    > BUT THAT'S LIKE. ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS (#9)

---

-   Battler and Virgilia are in front of (Beatrice's) coffin
-   Written in the book was a dream that would be more enjoyable for her than any other
-   The tale will be shut up with you in your coffin, for all eternity. So no one will be able to read it except for you.

    > A truth that only needs to pass between them.

    ![so many emotions](assets/Umineko5to8_2sVEPlQNbF.png)

-   Man sprinting through a twilight street
    > Willard? The guy from that other department mentioned in the decalogue tip?
-   Had several experiments to do, things to check

    ![wooo 4:3](assets/Umineko5to8_rYoxSplgwU.png)

    > We're using original backgrounds in 4:3 now btw. I like them more

-   You cannot neglect the motive
-   _Virgilia_: It is time for us to leave. If we're too noisy, we'll wake her from her dream

    ![how is "shannon" going to get out of this](assets/Umineko5to8_SXKpmw7WUw.png)

-   The motive can be **squeezed out** of the culprit afterwards
-   Know that we of the SSVD possess methods of forcing unrepentant criminals to reveal the truth
    > Lot like Erika.
-   willard BURSTS into the room and says they've got the wrong culprit

    ![raw af](assets/Umineko5to8_vrZBJgVV02.png)

    > So fucking based... kino... swag...

-   Lack of an alibi $\neq$ culprit
-   The other alibis weren't perfect. Look for a motive!

    ![this guy rules](assets/Umineko5to8_dpRhdgDNyX.png)

# It is forbidden for a servant to be the culprit

> **WHAT??!!?!?!??!?!?**

> HOW

# Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #11.

> Servants--such as butlers, footmen, valets, game-keepers, cooks, and the like--must not be chosen by the author as the culprit.

> WHAT THE FUCK

-   Double check the alibis for the second wife and her lover
    > Eva and Hideyoshi? I mean, Eva was definitely one of the culprits in game 3
-   "All the suspicious must be interrogated! That is how we conduct our witch trials!"

    > Ok Erika

    > Once again, unfalsifiable does not mean true

    ![no one can expose these truths](assets/Umineko5to8_VRr3Bu7JVe.png)

    > Really dunking on Erika here

-   _Willard_: Your boyfriend said that he'd be willing to give up everything to prove your alibi
    > George?
-   _Willard_: Meeting together in secret while on the job is hardly praiseworthy.

    ![otherwise, we're just intellectual rapists](assets/Umineko5to8_8nVKC4j7tm.png)

    > Erika is no detective according to this guy

-   Willard has already filed his resignation...

---

-   Will enters the chapel, and it's oddly similar to the cathedral from the game board

    > Reception desk and all

    ![LMFAO](assets/Umineko5to8_naEeSNAuV2.png)

    > OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

    > BEEAAATORIIICHEEEEEEEEEEE

-   Everyone is remembering the dead in their own way
-   Notably, Rosa is saying she killed her
    > 19 years ago
-   There is no corpse. Just the book that Battler left

    > Huh...

    ![HUH?](assets/Umineko5to8_Kq2MiP5KJ4.png)

    > Are they... the baby from 19 years ago?

    > They can't be, right? Timeline shenanigans are allowed though, I think.

-   Even Will doesn't know who the fuck she is
-   _Will_: Krauss's child is supposed to be Jessica
-   _Lion_: Jessica is my little sister. Do you need me to call for her?
-   Bern makes her appearance after Will calls out to her
-   Apparently, some game has already started
-   _Bern_: I've just moved from Beato's cat box into a larger one. Lion is one of the pieces who has a possibility of appearing inside it
    > ...Maybe they really are the baby.
-   Lion is a piece Bern placed

    ![Erika? Who's that?](assets/Umineko5to8_L7B6dJBcti.png)

    > Ominous...

-   Lion will succeed the headship when she turns 20... not Krauss
-   Silver ring for the successor
    > That's new.
-   _Bern_: Wright, try and beat this game.
-   Wright refuses
    > Why did he even come here then?
-   He's incapable of refusing an invitation from Bern
-   _Bern_: 'Who killed Beatrice?' That's my game.
    > Huh. That wasn't even one of my nine questions
-   Lion will be Will's ally

# Van Dine's Twenty Rules, Rule #7. It is forbidden to have a crime without a corpse.

-   The corpse could still exist. It's just not in the casket

# Rule #1. It is forbidden to have a crime without all clues presented.

# Don't worry. Everything is gathered here.

![as you like](assets/Umineko5to8_JoZbyEawh5.png)

-   Will now has to explain the current situation to Lion

    > Honestly, me as well. I get that this 7th game is intended to explain everything that's happened so far. All the tricks, the culprit, and the motive.

    > But since when was this about who killed Beatrice?

    > I thought this was about the murder of the entire family...

    > It's past October 5th as well! And where the fuck is Battler?

-   Will throws a rose and it freezes in midair, turning into a black husk
-   _Will_: This chapel has been cut off from the Fragment. We're currently locked in a concentrated loop of time
